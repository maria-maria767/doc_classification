**Memorandum**

TO: All Department Heads  
FROM: Jane Doe, Chief Operating Officer  
DATE: April 1, 2023  
SUBJECT: Implementation of New Employee Performance Review System

This memorandum serves to inform all department heads about the upcoming implementation of our new Employee Performance Review System (EPRS).

**Background**  
The organization has been utilizing the same performance review system for the past 10 years. After careful examination and feedback from various stakeholders, we have decided to upgrade our system to better reflect our organization's values and performance metrics.

**Implementation Date**  
The new EPRS will be effective starting Q3 of 2023, with the first assessments to be conducted in January 2024.

**Key Changes**  
1. **Performance Categories:** We are moving from a 3-tier to a 5-tier rating system to allow for more nuanced assessments.
2. **360-Degree Feedback:** Employees will receive feedback not only from their supervisors but also from peers and direct reports where applicable.
3. **Goal Alignment:** Each employee's performance goals will be directly linked to departmental and organizational objectives.
4. **Continuous Feedback:** The EPRS will allow for continuous feedback, rather than annual reviews only.
5. **Self-Assessment:** Including a self-assessment component as part of the review process.

**Action Required**  
1. **Training:** Department heads are required to attend a training session on the new EPRS on May 15, 2023.
2. **Communication:** Inform your team about the new system by June 1, 2023, and ensure understanding and readiness for the transition.
3. **Pilot Group:** Select two employees from your department to participate in a pilot run of the new system in July 2023 and provide feedback.

**Support and Resources**  
There will be detailed instructions, FAQs, and support personnel available to assist with the transition. Human Resources will be sending out a schedule of informational sessions and will be available for one-on-one consultation.
