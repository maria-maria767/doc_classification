MEMORANDUM

To: Zailey Andy Lindley
From: Nikodemos Markov Sinisa
Date: April 1, 2023
Subject: Multiskin Partnership Proposal Review

Dear Zailey,

This memorandum describes and evaluates the terms of the proposed partnership between our company, Education Alliance Group, and Multiskin. This information is sensitive and should not be shared outside of the authorized personnel. Our discussion and any decision reached must remain within the confines of those with a need-to-know status within our company.

Summary of Proposal:
Multiskin has proposed a joint venture that would leverage our educational platforms to promote their skin care products. The partnership includes co-branded educational material, targeted advertising to our user base, and potential product placements during events and webinars.

Key Terms:
1. Duration of Partnership: 24 months, with an option to renew based on performance metrics.
2. Revenue Sharing: Multiskin offers a 70-30 revenue split in their favor concerning the direct sales originating from our platforms.
3. Intellectual Property: Jointly developed educational content will be co-owned, with the right of first refusal for buyout by either party should the partnership dissolve.
4. Exclusivity: Multiskin requires exclusive rights as the sole skin care product provider advertised on our platforms during the term of the agreement.

Confidential Evaluation:
The financial team has modeled the projected revenues from this partnership and finds the terms to be moderately favorable, with an estimated increase of 12% in net revenue attributed to the new stream. However, the Marketing Department has raised concerns about the exclusivity clause, fearing it may limit future partnerships with other health and wellness companies.

Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a focus group comprised of our current users to gauge the anticipated response to introducing skin care products into the educational environment.
- Negotiate the terms of the revenue split to aim for an equitable 50-50 share.
- Consult with the legal team to thoroughly review and revise the intellectual property clause to protect our assets and future content development.
- Evaluate the potential impact of the exclusivity clause on long-term growth and diversification.

Conclusion:
I recommend scheduling an internal strategic meeting with the key department heads to review this memorandum and provide their input by no later than April 10, 2023. Following this, should we agree to proceed, I suggest we request a formal negotiation session with Multiskin to discuss the terms in detail.

Please handle the information contained in this memorandum with the utmost confidentiality and ensure it is kept secure at all times. If you have any immediate concerns or insights, feel free to contact me directly at d.a12@turner-patterson.online or via phone at 4717276349.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Nikodemos Markov Sinisa
Chief Partnership Officer
Education Alliance Group
