Subject: Urgent Business Review and Adjustments

Dear Georgios Gjurićik Alfred and Pankovski,

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the end of the first quarter, it is crucial that we review our progress and make any necessary adjustments to our business strategies.

As we discussed in our last meeting, the market conditions have changed significantly, and we need to adapt our marketing and sales approach accordingly. Our competitors are becoming increasingly aggressive, and we need to stay ahead of the game.

After reviewing the data and analyzing the market trends, I recommend that we shift our focus to the Spanish and Italian markets. Specifically, I suggest that we target the cities of Cremona and Pavia in Italy and Tegueste in Spain. These regions have shown significant growth in demand for our products, and we can capitalize on this trend.

To achieve our goals, I suggest that we allocate our resources accordingly. We should increase our marketing efforts in these regions, invest in local advertising campaigns, and provide additional training to our sales team to better understand the local markets.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter. I would appreciate your feedback and any additional suggestions you may have.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at +55 87 9 1031-9900 or at [d.a12@turner-patterson.online](mailto:d.a12@turner-patterson.online).

Sincerely,

Georgios Gjurićik Alfred
CEO, Brighton Wray
