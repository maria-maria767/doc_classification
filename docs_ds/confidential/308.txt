PROPOSAL

Subject: Business Partnership Proposal

Dear Mr. Phillip Patsev Leonardi,

We are excited to present this proposal to you for a potential business partnership between our organizations. As you may know, Northern Recruitment Pty Ltd is a leading recruitment agency in Australia, and Hotel Victoria is a well-known hotel in Latvia. We believe that a partnership between our organizations can create valuable opportunities for both of us.

Our proposal involves a joint venture in which we would offer staffing solutions to the hospitality industry in Latvia. By combining our resources, we believe we can provide top-notch recruitment services to hotels, restaurants, and other hospitality businesses in the region.

We propose that Northern Recruitment Pty Ltd would provide the expertise and manpower to staff the hotels, while Hotel Victoria would provide the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the recruitment process. This partnership would allow us to expand our offerings and reach new markets, and we believe it would be beneficial for both of our organizations.

We understand the importance of confidentiality and security in a business partnership, and we assure you that all sensitive information shared between our organizations will be treated with the highest level of protection. This proposal is confidential and intended for internal use only, and we ask that you do not share it with anyone outside of our organizations.

We would be happy to discuss this proposal further with you at your earliest convenience. Please feel free to contact us at [leo-forrest3962@mitchell-sexton.com](mailto:leo-forrest3962@mitchell-sexton.com) or +91 (076) 518 45 67 to schedule a meeting.
