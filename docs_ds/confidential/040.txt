MEMORANDUM

DATE: [Current Date]

TO: All Department Leads

FROM: [Your Name], Head of Operations

SUBJECT: Revised Travel and Expense Policy Implementation

Dear Team Leaders,

As part of our ongoing effort to streamline operational efficiencies and manage costs, the Senior Management Team has revised the company's Travel and Expense Policy. The purpose of this memorandum is to inform you of the upcoming changes and your responsibilities with regards to the implementation. 

Key Changes:
1. Pre-Approval: All travel must be pre-approved by the respective department head. Pre-approval forms must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the booking of any travel.
2. Accommodation: Use of approved hotels is now mandated, with a preferred supplier list provided to maximize our corporate rates and benefits.
3. Flights: Economy class will be the standard for domestic travel. Business class may be authorized for international flights exceeding six hours, subject to approval.
4. Daily Meals & Incidentals: A reduction in per diem rates aligning with industry standards. The new rates are provided in the attached policy document.
5. Transportation: Use of rideshare services (e.g., Uber, Lyft) is encouraged over traditional taxi services for cost-efficiency. Company-provided shuttle services at designated locations should be used whenever possible.

Implementation:
- The revised policy will take effect on [Effective Date].
- Department leads are responsible for communicating these changes to their teams by [Communication Deadline].
- Training on the new policy will be provided through a mandatory online module, which must be completed by all employees who travel for business. Details on how to access this module will be sent in a separate communication.
- Compliance with the new policy will be monitored through regular audits. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action.

Your role is critical in ensuring a smooth transition to the updated policy. Please review the attached policy document in detail and prepare to address any questions your team members might have.

Should you have any immediate concerns or need clarification on the policy changes, we have scheduled a briefing session on [Briefing Date & Time]. Please make it a point to attend.

We appreciate your cooperation and diligent attention to this important matter. Effective management of travel and expenses is vital to our company's financial health, and your support is crucial in upholding these standards.

Thank you.
