From: Jane Doe, Chief Executive Officer

Date: April 15, 2023

Subject: Implementation of New Data Security Protocols

Purpose:
The purpose of this memorandum is to introduce enhanced data security protocols to safeguard our proprietary and customer data. With recent increases in cyber threats, it is imperative that we take immediate steps to protect our digital assets.

Action Required:
1. By May 1, 2023, all departments must require two-factor authentication (2FA) for all employee logins to company systems.
2. By June 1, 2023, all critical data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
3. Customer data access should be audited, and access logs must be reviewed weekly by department leads.
4. Department Heads are responsible for scheduling mandatory data security training for their teams to be completed by July 1, 2023.

Implementation Guidelines:
- IT department will provide 2FA setup instructions by April 20, 2023.
- IT support will assist with the encryption process for each department. Schedule your session by contacting IT by May 15, 2023.
- Regular audits on data access should be documented and reports sent to the Data Security Officer by COB every Friday.
- The HR department will coordinate with external security consultants to facilitate security training sessions. Training dates will be communicated by April 30, 2023.

Budget:
Each department is allocated an additional $5,000 from the central budget to support the implementation of these security measures. Expenditure should be reported to the Finance Department with full documentation.
