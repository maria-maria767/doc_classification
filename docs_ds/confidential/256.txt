Subject: Strategic Planning for Q2 Market Expansion

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this document is to outline the strategic approach for the upcoming quarter's market expansion initiatives for Cliffs Car Care. This plan has been developed to ensure a coordinated and efficient expansion into the Lecco and Como regions, with a focus on establishing our brand presence and penetrating the local market effectively.

MARKET ANALYSIS

Our preliminary market analysis indicates that both Lecco and Como have witnessed a surge in automotive sales, which correlates with an increased demand for high-quality car care services. Establishing our presence in these cities could therefore be strategically beneficial and lead to an increase in our consumer base and overall revenue.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE

We aim to increase market share in the Northern Italian region by at least 15% by the end of Q3. To do so, we must set up the physical and digital infrastructure needed to support this growth, including service centers and localized marketing campaigns.

ACTION ITEMS

1. Establish two new service centers - one in Lecco and another in Como.
   - Begin location scouting by May 15, 2023.
   - Secure leasing agreements no later than June 30, 2023.
   - Allocated budget: €250,000 for initial setup costs.

2. Localized Marketing Campaign Development
   - Develop a marketing strategy specifically tailored to the Lecco and Como demographic by May 10, 2023.
   - Launch a digital marketing campaign by June 1, 2023.
   - Allocated budget: €75,000 for marketing initiatives.

3. Recruitment and Training
   - Hire and train service center staff to ensure that operations can begin smoothly as soon as the centers are ready.
   - Recruitment start date: May 20, 2023.
   - Complete staff training by July 15, 2023.
   - Allocated budget: €50,000 for recruitment and training processes.
