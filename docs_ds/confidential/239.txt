Subject: Revised Social Media Policy

Effective immediately, the company has revised its social media policy in order to strengthen our brand presence and protect proprietary information. Please find below the key points of the revised policy:

1. Use of Company Branding - Any use of the company's logo or name on social media must be approved by the Marketing Department to ensure consistency across platforms.

2. Personal Accounts - Employees are asked to refrain from discussing clients, financials, or any other proprietary information related to the company on personal social media accounts.

3. Official Accounts - Only designated employees may post on behalf of the company's official social media accounts. All content must be pre-approved by the Social Media Coordinator.

4. Crisis Communication - In the event of a PR crisis, all employees should direct media inquiries to our Public Relations Department and refrain from commenting on any platform, personal or otherwise.

5. Employee Conduct - While the company respects the right to free speech, any content that could potentially damage the company's reputation or reveal sensitive information is strictly prohibited.

Please ensure that all team members within your department are briefed on this policy by no later than April 30, 2023. For detailed guidelines, please refer to the attached "Social Media Policy Handbook".

Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. If you or your team members have any questions, please contact the HR Department.

Thank you for your cooperation and diligence in upholding our company's values and reputation.
