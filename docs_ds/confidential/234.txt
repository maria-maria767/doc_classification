Subject: Immediate Changes to the Employee Vacation Policy

Effective immediately, the company has made significant revisions to the employee vacation policy. This policy change reflects our ongoing commitment to supporting a healthy work-life balance while maintaining operational efficiency. Please note that this information is confidential and should only be communicated to your respective teams via scheduled department meetings by April 20, 2023.

**Key Changes:**

1. **Accrual Rates** – The vacation accrual rates have been adjusted. Employees will now accrue vacation time at a rate of 1.25 days per month of service, an increase from the previous 1.00-day rate.

2. **Maximum Carry-Over** – The maximum carry-over of vacation days from one fiscal year into the next has been increased from 5 days to 10 days. Any excess days will continue to be forfeited.

3. **Sabbatical Leave** – A new sabbatical leave policy is being introduced. Full-time employees with 7 or more years of continuous service are eligible for a one-time sabbatical of up to 30 business days, in addition to the regular vacation time.

**Implementation:**

- **Transition** – HR will calculate and adjust vacation balances to reflect the new accrual rate by May 1, 2023. Employees with 7 or more years of service can start applying for sabbatical leave effective June 1, 2023.
  
- **Usage of Vacation Days** – Employees are encouraged to schedule their vacation days in advance and are required to have their manager's approval to ensure proper staffing levels are maintained.

- **Reporting** – Department Heads must submit an updated vacation schedule to HR by May 15, 2023, reflecting the vacation plans for their employees for the remainder of the year.

**Responsibilities:**

- **Managers** are responsible for communicating these changes to their team members and for managing vacation scheduling in accordance with the new policy.
