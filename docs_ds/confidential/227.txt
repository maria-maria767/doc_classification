Dear Gomez and Rostislav,

We are excited to propose a joint venture partnership between our two organizations, Matthias vermeersch and Vbg Engineering - India, to work on a new project. This partnership will bring together our unique strengths and expertise to create a successful and profitable outcome.

The project will focus on the development of a new software application for the financial sector. Our combined knowledge and experience in the field will be invaluable in creating a product that meets the needs of the industry.

To ensure the success of this project, we propose the following terms for our agreement:

1. Equal Ownership: Both parties will own 50% of the joint venture partnership.
2. Governance: A board of directors will be established to oversee the management and operations of the partnership.
3. Profits: All profits generated by the partnership will be shared equally between the two organizations.
4. Confidentiality: All information shared between the two organizations must be kept confidential and not shared with any third parties.

We believe that this partnership will be mutually beneficial and bring great success to both of our organizations. We are looking forward to working together on this project and reaching a final agreement.

Sincerely,
