MEMORANDUM

TO: All Department Heads
FROM: Jane Doe, Chief Financial Officer
DATE: April 1, 2023
SUBJECT: Budget Allocation for Fiscal Year 2023-2024

Purpose:
The purpose of this memorandum is to inform department heads of the budget allocation process for the upcoming fiscal year and the changes that will be implemented to enhance our financial planning and spending efficacy.

Budget Allocations:
Each department will receive an initial budget allocation based on the previous year's financial performance and projected needs for the upcoming year. The allocations are as follows:
- Research and Development: $1,500,000
- Marketing: $750,000
- Sales: $600,000
- Operations: $1,200,000
- Information Technology: $850,000
- Human Resources: $400,000

Critical Changes:
The Finance Department has introduced several changes to the budget process to better track expenses and improve accountability across departments:

1. Quarterly Budget Reviews:
   We will conduct a mandatory review of departmental spending and project progress every quarter. It is essential that each department prepares a comprehensive report for these reviews.

2. Expense Justifications:
   All expenses exceeding $10,000 must include a detailed justification form that outlines the necessity and expected return on investment for the expense.

3. Reallocation of Unused Funds:
   Departments that anticipate being under budget must notify the Finance Department before the end of each quarter. This may lead to a reallocation of unused funds to other departments or projects that show promise or require additional resources.

Deadline:
Please submit your department's budget proposal with projected expenditures for the next fiscal year to the Finance Department by May 15, 2023. Any department failing to submit by this deadline may face delays in their funding approval.

Training Sessions:
The Finance Department will hold training sessions on the new budget management system on April 10 and April 17 in the main conference room. Attendance is mandatory for all Department Financial Officers.

Thank you for your cooperation and diligence in adhering to the updated budgeting process. Our collective efforts to manage our resources efficiently will contribute to the long-term financial health and success of our company.
