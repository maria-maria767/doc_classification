SUBJECT: Financial Assessment and Budget Allocation for Huesca Expansion Project

Dear Kokareva,

Following our earlier conversations and the strategic planning meetings concerning our expansion into the Huesca market, we have conducted a comprehensive financial assessment to determine the feasibility and budget allocation for the project. 

The preliminary budget estimates indicate a requirement of €3,500,000 to cover real estate acquisitions, local office setup, staffing, initial marketing campaigns, and other associated costs. An additional contingency fund of €500,000 is proposed to mitigate unforeseen expenses, bringing the total proposed budget to €4,000,000.

It is imperative to maintain the confidentiality of this financial information to prevent any speculation or misinterpretation that can affect our stock value or give our competitors an undue advantage. This document and its contents are to remain strictly within the authorized personnel circle as named above.

We have identified Persepolis Marketing Limited as our potential partner for local marketing and promotion activities based on the quality of their portfolio and their extensive network in the region. The preliminary engagement terms have been drafted but will require Spegelj’s legal review before finalization.

For the project launch, we will require the collaboration of Eric Film Productions for creating high-impact visual materials aimed at establishing brand presence swiftly. This initiative should be discreet until we are prepared for a full public roll-out.

Our internal target date for finalizing all preparations and commencing full-scale operations is set for Q3 2023. However, the timeline is dependent on the completion of the due diligence process by our legal team and subsequent contract negotiations.

For a detailed breakdown of the financial assessments, budget allocations, and proposed plans, please refer to the attached encrypted document, "Huesca_Expansion_Financial_Plans_DEA2203.xlsx".
