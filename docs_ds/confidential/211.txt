Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to you in regards to a matter of utmost importance to our organization. As you are aware, our company has been facing some challenges in meeting our quarterly targets. We have been working tirelessly to identify the root cause of the issue and find a way to overcome it.

After conducting a thorough analysis, we have discovered that one of our key suppliers has been providing us with substandard products that do not meet our quality standards. As a result, our products have been experiencing a high rate of defects, which has affected our sales and reputation in the market.

We have decided to terminate our contract with this supplier and are actively searching for a new one that can meet our quality requirements. However, we understand that this may cause some disruptions in our production process, and we want to inform you of this situation as soon as possible.

We will do our best to minimize any negative impact on our operations and ensure that our customers receive the best possible service. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this time and thank you for your continued support.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
