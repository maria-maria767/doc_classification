Subject: Urgent Business Proposal - Strictly Confidential

Dear Georgios Gjurićik Alfred,

I hope this email finds you well. I trust that you have had a chance to review the information provided in our previous correspondence. I am writing to you today in reference to the urgent matter regarding the confidential business proposal that I shared with you on March 15th, 2023.

As we have previously discussed, the success of our joint venture will be critical for the growth and development of both our companies. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that we maintain strict confidentiality regarding the sensitive information that has been shared between us.

As you are aware, the details of our proposed partnership involve proprietary technology and strategic plans that are considered highly confidential. Sharing this information with unauthorized individuals could result in severe consequences for both parties involved.

Therefore, I must reiterate the importance of maintaining the strictest confidentiality regarding this matter. Please ensure that you disclose the information only to the necessary personnel within your organization who are directly involved in the project.

Additionally, I would like to request that we arrange a secure means of communication to further safeguard the confidentiality of our discussions. This could include setting up a secure email account or using encrypted messaging services.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter, and whether you have any additional concerns or questions that you would like to discuss.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

Brighton Wray
