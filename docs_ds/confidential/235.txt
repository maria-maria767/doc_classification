Dear Team Leaders,

As part of our commitment to continuously improve our workforce’s productivity and satisfaction, we are excited to announce the implementation of a new Employee Performance Management System (EPMS).

Key Features of the EPMS are as follows:

1. Goal Setting: Employees and managers can collaboratively set and update performance goals throughout the year.

2. Real-Time Feedback: The EPMS will feature a real-time feedback tool that allows for ongoing communication between employees and managers.

3. Performance Reviews: Simplified performance review processes, with customizable templates and easy-to-use rating scales.

4. Analytics: Robust reporting features for departmental and company-wide performance analysis.

5. Learning and Development: Personalized training recommendations for employees based on performance evaluations.

Implementation Plan:

Phase 1: System Setup (Date: [Start Date])
- Technical setup and customization of the EPMS.
- Initial training session for the IT department and EPMS administrators.

Phase 2: Manager Training (Date: [Following Phase 1])
- Comprehensive training for all Department Heads and managers on how to use the new system effectively.

Phase 3: Employee Onboarding (Date: [Following Phase 2])
- Briefing sessions for all employees, explaining the benefits of the EPMS.
- Hands-on training to help employees navigate and utilize the system.

Phase 4: Company-wide Rollout (Date: [Following Phase 3])
- The EPMS will go live for use by all team members.

We encourage managers to familiarize themselves with the new system as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition. A series of training sessions and resources will be made available to support you in this change.

Please note that all data within the EPMS is considered confidential and should be treated according to our company’s Information Security Policies. Access to the EPMS is restricted to authorized personnel only, and any breach of confidentiality will be subject to disciplinary action.
