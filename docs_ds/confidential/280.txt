Subject: New Data Encryption Protocols
Date: April 7, 2023

1. Introduction
The purpose of this memorandum is to outline the implementation of new data encryption protocols across our company to enhance the security of our confidential data and intellectual property. This is part of our ongoing effort to strengthen our cybersecurity infrastructure against potential threats. This document is confidential and should not be disclosed to non-authorized personnel.

2. New Encryption Protocols
Effective immediately, all departments are required to implement the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit encryption for all sensitive internal communication, data storage, and data transfer. This applies to both digital and physical records.

3. Implementation Guidelines
- Upgrade all departmental systems to support AES 256-bit encryption.
- Ensure all transferred files are encrypted before dispatch.
- Encrypt all stored sensitive documents, both in cloud and on-premise environments.
- Physical documents containing sensitive information must be kept in a secure location with access limited to authorized individuals only.

4. Staff Training
A mandatory training session for all employees will be conducted on April 21, 2023. The training will cover the fundamentals of encryption, secure handling of sensitive data, and the proper use of encryption tools. Attendance is essential and non-attendance must be justified to your department head.

5. Compliance
Departments must confirm compliance with these new protocols by May 15, 2023. A cross-departmental audit will be conducted to ensure full implementation. Non-compliance will be subject to disciplinary action, as deemed necessary by the management.

6. Questions
All inquiries regarding the new protocols or training details should be addressed to the IT security manager, Jane Smith, via email at jsmith@company.com.

Your cooperation in this important security matter is expected and appreciated.
