To ensure the success of this project, we propose the following terms for our agreement:

1. Equal Ownership: Both parties will own 50% of the joint venture partnership.
2. Governance: A board of directors will be established to oversee the management and operations of the partnership.
3. Profits: All profits generated by the partnership will be shared equally between the two organizations.

We believe that this partnership will be mutually beneficial and bring great success to both of our organizations. We are looking forward to working together on this exciting project.
