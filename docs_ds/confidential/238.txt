Subject: Confidential Employee Satisfaction Survey Results

Purpose:
The purpose of this confidential memo is to discuss the recent findings of the Internal Employee Satisfaction Survey carried out in Q1, and to outline the recommended actions to address the key issues identified.

Overview:
The survey was administered to all current employees of Cliffs Car Care, across various departments including Sales, Service, and Administration. The goal was to gain insights into employee morale, satisfaction with current work conditions, and open dialogue for potential improvement areas.

Key Findings:
1. Employee morale in the Service Department is relatively low, with concerns highlighted regarding the lack of communication from upper management.
2. Approximately 60% of respondents from the Sales Department feel their performance targets are unrealistic and have expressed the need for further training and support.
3. Administrative staff reported high satisfaction with their work environment but have pointed out that current health benefits do not meet their needs.

Recommendations:
1. Improve communication within the Service Department by establishing bi-weekly meetings with management to ensure employees feel heard and valued.
2. Review and adjust sales targets in line with industry standards and consider implementing additional training sessions for the Sales team.
3. Engage with a new health insurance provider to offer a more comprehensive benefits package that meets the diverse needs of our administrative staff.

Action Items:
- Schedule a department head meeting on [Specific Date] to discuss the implementation of these recommendations.
- Radivoje Rybakov Veronika to research potential health insurance providers and present findings by [Specific Date].
- Shivam, Sales Manager, to conduct a review of current targets and report back with a proposal for adjustments.

Budget Implications:
Some of the recommendations, particularly those related to health insurance, may have budgetary implications. A detailed cost analysis will be conducted once potential providers have been identified.

Conclusion:
The feedback collected from the Employee Satisfaction Survey is invaluable in helping us understand the needs of our employees. It is critical that we take prompt and thoughtful action to address the issues that have been raised. Employees must be kept confidential from the specifics of this survey, and all follow-up actions should maintain the sensitivity of this information.
