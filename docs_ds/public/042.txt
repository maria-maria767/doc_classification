Natco Transport Announces New Eco-Friendly Initiatives 

Raymond Street, Hudson, United States of America – April 10, 2023 – Natco Transport, a leader in logistics solutions, is proud to announce a new set of sustainability measures designed to significantly reduce the environmental impact of its fleet operations. These initiatives underscore our commitment to eco-friendly business practices and responsible corporate citizenship.

The new eco-friendly policies include:

1. Fleet Upgrade: Our logistics fleet will be upgraded to include the newest low-emission vehicles, reducing our carbon footprint while maintaining high standards of service. The new vehicles will be phased into operation starting June 2023.

2. Renewable Energy: To align with our green objectives, Natco Transport will transition 25% of its warehouse operations to solar energy by the end of the fiscal year, resulting in decreased reliance on non-renewable power sources.

3. Recycling Program: Natco Transport is launching an extensive recycling program across all our offices aimed at minimizing waste from our operational activities. The initiative will be in collaboration with local recycling centers around our major hubs.

These measures are part of our broader strategy to promote environmental sustainability, not only within our company but across the logistics industry. At Natco Transport, we believe that taking action to protect our planet is imperative for creating a sustainable future for our business, community, and the environment.
