**Date:** April 14, 2023

**For Immediate Release**

Green Energy Solutions Ltd. is proud to announce the launch of our innovative Solar Panel Recycling Program, a significant stride towards sustainable energy and environmental responsibility. This initiative reflects our ongoing commitment to reducing carbon footprint and adhering to circular economy principles. 

As solar panels reach the end of their lifecycle, the need for responsible disposal methods becomes increasingly crucial. Our recycling program ensures that valuable materials used in the manufacturing of solar panels, such as glass, aluminum, silicon, and small amounts of precious metals, are effectively reclaimed and repurposed, reducing waste and conserving resources.

**Recycling Program Details:**

- **Start Date:** July 1, 2023
- **Recycling Facilities Locations:** Green Energy Solutions Ltd. has partnered with EcoReclaim Facilities in the following locations: Springfield, Meadowfield, and Brookhaven.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** All types and brands of solar panels that have reached the end of their functional lifespan.
- **Drop-off Times:** Monday to Friday, from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM.
- **Contact for Queries:** recycling@greenenergysolutions.com

**Environmental Impact Goals:**

- Reduce landfill waste by 2,000 tons within the first year of operation.
- Recover and repurpose up to 90% of the materials from each recycled solar panel.
- Reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with solar panel production by contributing to a closed-loop supply chain.

We invite our customers, stakeholders, and the broader community to join us in advocating for a greener planet by participating in the Solar Panel Recycling Program. Together, we can make a substantial impact on environmental conservation and work towards a sustainable future for all.
