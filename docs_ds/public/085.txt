Subject: Introduction of New Wellness Program - Partnership with West Wimbledon Physiotherapy Clinic

Dear Team,

We are excited to announce that in our continuous effort to promote the health and wellbeing of our employees, we have partnered with the West Wimbledon Physiotherapy Clinic to introduce a new comprehensive wellness program available to all staff members effective immediately.

This initiative is part of our commitment to creating a supportive and thriving work environment. The program will include the following benefits:

1. Complimentary Initial Assessment: Each employee is entitled to a free initial physiotherapy assessment at the West Wimbledon Physiotherapy Clinic. To schedule your assessment, please contact Petra Manuel Tenney via email at e-o@gmail.com or by phone at 2509264626.

2. Discounted Services: Employees will receive a 20% discount on all subsequent services offered by the clinic, including physiotherapy, massage, and rehabilitative exercises.

3. Health and Wellness Workshops: Monthly workshops will be conducted on various health topics such as posture correction, stress management, and injury prevention. The first workshop will take place on May 15, 2023, at our main office located at 15 Kohler Lahna, Ahrntal - Valle Aurina, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol 39030, Italia.

4. Custom Wellness Plans: The West Wimbledon Physiotherapy Clinic will work with interested employees to create personalized wellness plans tailored to their specific needs.

We believe that this program will be a valuable asset to our workforce and encourage all employees to take full advantage of the services offered. Participation in the program is voluntary, however, we hope that many of you will join us in embracing a healthier lifestyle.

For any questions or further information about the wellness program, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Let's take this step together towards a healthier and more productive workplace.
