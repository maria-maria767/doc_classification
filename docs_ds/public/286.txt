Dear Mr. Toshev,

I hope this letter finds you well. We at Safeway Tyres are interested in purchasing a large quantity of hydraulic hoses for our manufacturing processes. After researching several suppliers, we have chosen to reach out to Hydac Hydraulic Div. for a quotation.

We require 1,000 hydraulic hoses, each measuring 2 meters in length, with a nominal inside diameter of 12 mm and a working pressure of 350 bar. We would like to request a quotation for this item, including any relevant shipping and handling fees.

If you are able to provide us with a quotation, please include the following information:

* Unit price per hose
* Total price for 1,000 hoses
* Lead time for delivery
* Shipping and handling fees
* Any other relevant details or terms and conditions

We look forward to hearing from you soon and appreciate your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
