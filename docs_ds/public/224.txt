Subject: Request for Service

Dear Multiskin Customer Service Team,

I am writing to request a service for my Multiskin product. My name is Eleanore Adam and my email address is [eleanore.adam@hotmail.com](mailto:eleanore.adam@hotmail.com). I purchased the product on March 15, 2023, and it is currently experiencing issues.

The product in question is a Multiskin facial cream, which I purchased from the Multiskin website. The product has not been functioning as expected and has caused me some discomfort. I would like to request a replacement or a refund for the product.

I have attached a copy of my purchase receipt for your reference. Please let me know what steps I need to take to proceed with this request. I would appreciate it if someone could contact me at 1819365934 or [eleanore.adam@hotmail.com](mailto:eleanore.adam@hotmail.com) to discuss this matter further.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

Eleanore Adam
