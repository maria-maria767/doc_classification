Policy and Procedure: Customer Complaint Resolution

Introduction:
At Themaverde, we value our customers and strive to provide the best possible service. However, we understand that complaints may arise from time to time, and we have established a process for resolving customer complaints in a timely and effective manner. This policy and procedure outlines the steps that must be followed to ensure that customer complaints are handled professionally and efficiently.

Policy:
Themaverde commits to responding to all customer complaints in a timely and professional manner. All complaints will be documented and tracked to ensure that they are resolved in a satisfactory manner. The company will make every effort to resolve complaints at the first point of contact, but if this is not possible, a complaint resolution process will be followed.

Procedure:
Step 1: The customer should initially contact the customer service team by email, phone or through our online complaints form. The complaint will be logged in our system, and the customer will be provided with a reference number.

Step 2: The customer service team will investigate the complaint and respond to the customer within 24 hours of receipt of the complaint.

Step 3: If the complaint is not resolved at this stage, the customer will be given the option to escalate the complaint to a manager.

Step 4: The manager will investigate the complaint and respond to the customer within five working days of receipt of the complaint.

Step 5: If the complaint still has not been resolved, the customer will be given the option to escalate the complaint further to a senior manager or to the company's customer services team.

Step 6: The senior manager will investigate the complaint and respond to the customer within 10 working days of receipt of the complaint.

Step 7: If the complaint is still not resolved, the customer will be given the option to take the complaint to an alternative dispute resolution service or to seek legal advice.

Conclusion:
Themaverde is committed to providing the best possible service to our customers. We believe that resolving complaints in a timely and effective manner is crucial to maintaining a positive relationship with our customers. This policy and procedure has been established to ensure that we can achieve this goal. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this policy and procedure, please contact customer services.
