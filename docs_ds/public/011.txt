**IN THE MATTER OF TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT: DOLPHIN SUPPLY v. SALLY**

**Legal Brief**

To Whom It May Concern,

Pursuant to the regulations outlined by the appropriate jurisdiction, this legal brief has been drafted in reference to the current matter of alleged trademark infringement by the defendant, Sally, against the plaintiff, Dolphin Supply, henceforth referred to as 'the Plaintiff' and 'the Defendant' respectively.

I. **Background**

The Plaintiff, Dolphin Supply, an established provider of maritime equipment with its principal place of business at 483 Forge Road North Kingstown, Rhode Island 02852, alleges that the Defendant, operating under the trade name 'Sally', has engaged in unauthorized use of the Plaintiff's registered trademark in connection with the sale of navigational instruments. The Plaintiff contends that such use constitutes an infringement of the Plaintiff's trademark rights under governing law.

II. **Specific Allegations**

1. The Plaintiff is the rightful owner of the trademark in question, the usage of which has been continuous and uninterrupted in the market.
2. The Defendant, located at Carrer Vinatea, Benaguasil, Comunitat Valenciana, has been selling similar maritime products under a mark that is confusingly similar to the Plaintiff's registered trademark.
3. Such usage by the Defendant has led to confusion among consumers, thereby causing harm to the Plaintiff's reputation and goodwill associated with the said trademark.

III. **Legal Grounds**

The use of a trademark that results in likely confusion among consumers as to the source of the goods is a violation of intellectual property rights enshrined in both federal and state law. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant's actions contravene these laws, and legal remedies including injunctive relief and damages are warranted.

IV. **Prayer for Relief**

1. A declaration that the Defendant has infringed the Plaintiff's trademark.
2. An immediate and permanent injunction to restrain the Defendant from further use of the mark or any confusingly similar variation thereof.
3. An assessment of damages to compensate for the Plaintiff's losses attributable to the infringement.
4. An order directing the Defendant to perform all necessary actions to correct the wrongful association created by their unauthorized use, including but not limited to the withdrawal of all infringing products from the market.

V. **Conclusion**

The Plaintiff urges a timely and equitable resolution to this matter, affirming the sanctity of intellectual property rights and upholding justice. This brief is intended to outline the Plaintiff’s position and does not represent a comprehensive list of all evidence or arguments that may be presented. The Plaintiff reserves the right to amend or supplement as may be required.

Respectfully submitted,
