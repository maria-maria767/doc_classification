Company Newsletter - March 2023

Welcome to the March edition of the Multiskin Monthly round-up!

Multiskin has been a beacon of innovation and community development this month. Here’s what’s been happening:

**Multiskin’s New Product Launch**

We are thrilled to announce the release of our revolutionary skincare product, "HydraGlow." HydraGlow has been meticulously designed to cater to all skin types and ensure maximum hydration with its natural ingredients. We celebrated the launch with a vibrant event on March 6th, at 6/A Via Giovanni Amendola, Verona 37138, Veneto. It was an evening filled with excitement, demonstrations, and testimonials from our first group of users.

**Community Outreach**

Multiskin collaborates with Servpro of East Cobb to conduct a highly successful recycling initiative aimed at promoting environmental responsibility. Together, we have set up collection points at 6 Burwell Street, Saylesville, Rhode Island 02865, USA, encouraging the community to participate in sustaining a healthier planet.

**Employee Spotlight**

This month’s spotlight is on Eleanore Adam Terry, whose dedication to customer service has created numerous happy clients and who has been a great example of Multiskin's values. Eleanore can be reached at a.m@williams-butler.info for feedback and suggestions from our valued customers and community members.

Multiskin is excited to host a free public webinar on "The Importance of Sustainable Skincare" on April 10th, 2023. Join us to learn more about eco-friendly practices and how you can make a difference. Mark your calendars and stay tuned for more details!
