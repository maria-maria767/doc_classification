Dear Shareholders,

We are pleased to present the Annual Sales Report for the fiscal year 2022. This report summarizes the performance of our company, NextStep for Life, Inc., for the past year and highlights our achievements and challenges.

Sales Performance:

NextStep for Life, Inc. had a successful year in 2022, with a total sales revenue of $10 million. This represents a 10% increase from the previous year, which we attribute to our dedicated team and innovative products. Our top-selling product was the "Travel & Jobs Package," which accounted for 30% of our total sales revenue.

Geographic Sales Breakdown:

Our sales were distributed across various regions, with the United States accounting for 60% of our total sales revenue, followed by Europe (25%) and Asia (15%). Within Europe, our highest sales were generated in Italy (10%), Spain (5%), and France (5%).

Sales by Channel:

Our sales were generated through both online and offline channels. The online channel accounted for 70% of our total sales revenue, while the offline channel contributed the remaining 30%. We will continue to focus on our online sales channel, as it has shown consistent growth and has a higher profit margin.

Sales Team Performance:

We have a dedicated sales team of 20 members, who work tirelessly to promote our products and services. Our top-performing salesperson was Kristal, who generated 15% of the company's total sales revenue. We appreciate the efforts of all our sales team members and will continue to provide them with the necessary resources to succeed.

Challenges and Opportunities:

One of the main challenges we faced in 2022 was the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which affected our ability to travel and conduct face-to-face meetings with potential clients. However, we adapted quickly by increasing our online presence and utilizing virtual meeting tools. We believe that this shift towards digital sales will continue to benefit our company in the long run.

In 2023, we plan to expand our product line by introducing new travel and job-related products, which we believe will further increase our sales revenue. We also plan to invest in marketing campaigns to raise brand awareness and attract new customers.

Thank you for your continued support and confidence in NextStep for Life, Inc. We look forward to another successful year in 2023.

Sincerely,

Pere Caracoti Trendafil
CEO, NextStep for Life, Inc.
