INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

Date: April 1, 2024

To: Project Team Pegasus
From: Gail, Project Manager
Subject: Upcoming Project Milestone and Resource Allocation

Dear Team,

I trust this memo finds you well. As you are aware, our project 'Pegasus' has reached a critical milestone that requires utmost discretion and adherence to our internal protocols. Due to the sensitive nature of the data we're handling and the agreements with our client, Safeway Tyres, all information regarding the project must be kept within our authorized personnel only.

1. Upcoming Milestone
The next phase of development is scheduled to be completed by April 30, 2024. Specifically, this involves the implementation of the proprietary system developed by Lizuska Hrabovskyi Mariyah Robbins and Pribik Benda Etienne. This system will be the foundation for the advanced analytics module we promised to our client.

2. Resource Allocation
To ensure we meet our deadlines and maintain the quality of our work, I am assigning additional resources to the project. Please find the allocation details below:

- Lizuska Hrabovskyi will oversee the analytics algorithms refinement.
- Mariyah Robbins is tasked with finalizing the user interface along with the UX team.
- Pribik Benda Etienne will lead the backend development and ensure system interoperability.

All three leads will coordinate the integration phase, which is critical for the system's success.

3. Confidentiality Reminder
As a reminder, all documents, code snippets, and correspondence related to Project Pegasus must maintain a RESTRICTED classification. All team members must encrypt emails and store documents in our secure server only. Face-to-face conversations about project details should occur within secured areas of the office premises.
