**Internal Memorandum**

**To:** Phillip Francis Eliana Wooldridge Conway, VP of Strategic Development
**From:** Mislav Stassov Subhan Ieuan Wallace Lowe, Director of Research & Innovation
**Subject:** Strategic Analysis of occhi sunglasses Market Expansion

**Dear Phillip,**

This memorandum is a follow-up to our previous strategy sessions regarding the potential market expansion of occhi sunglasses into North Africa, with a focus on Algeria. The information contained within is classified as RESTRICTED and should only be disseminated among senior management and those directly involved with the project.

**Overview:**
North Africa represents a significant opportunity for occhi sunglasses due to the increasing demand for luxury goods. Algeria, in particular, is poised for rapid growth in the consumer sector, given the young and increasingly affluent population.

**Market Analysis:**
Our market research, spearheaded by Branka Prčal, has indicated a 15% year-over-year growth in the luxury accessory market within Algeria's urban centers. The analysis suggests that our diverse product lines will resonate well with the target demographic in cities such as Algiers and Oran.

**Distribution Strategy:**
In partnership with Adriandorado.Com, we have outlined a strategy for an exclusive online distribution channel complemented by targeted pop-up events. These events will be designed to increase brand awareness and build customer loyalty. Proposed dates and locations are detailed in a separate annex that will be circulated to Branka and authorized personnel.

**Budget Allocation:**
The initial budget proposal allocates $750,000 to cover market entry, including marketing campaigns and initial logistic setups. Please review the attached financial breakdown (Document #5673-R) and provide your input by COB Thursday.

**Market Entry Risks:**
Although the market is favorable, we must mitigate the risks related to currency fluctuation, potential import regulations, and the geopolitical climate. A detailed risk assessment report prepared by our legal team, led by Eliana Wooldridge Conway, will be provided under separate cover (Document #5674-R).

**Next Steps:**
Scheduled to convene with Mesit Holding's Board of Directors next month, your feedback on this memo will be crucial for the final presentation. Subsequent to your review, a meeting will be arranged with the heads of departments to discuss the operational execution pending board approval.

For any queries or further discussion, you may reach me at k-zitnjak@vip.hr or through my direct line at 4312059769.

**Conclusion:**
We stand on the cusp of a significant opportunity for occhi sunglasses. Our careful approach and proper execution of the strategies outlined herein will determine our success in the Algerian market.

Please handle this document with the utmost confidentiality.

Best regards,

**Mislav Stassov Subhan Ieuan Wallace Lowe**
