Minutes:
The meeting commenced at 11:00 am with all attendees present. Belevski began by presenting the sales performance report, which showed a slight decrease in revenue over the past quarter. This was attributed to a slowdown in consumer spending due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Borčkie then presented a proposal for new marketing strategies, which included increasing our online presence through social media advertisements and search engine optimization. Konečkini suggested targeting specific demographics through paid ads on social media platforms. Kirce added that we should also consider reaching out to influencers in our industry to collaborate on sponsored content.

Next, Francis provided an update on the status of ongoing projects. She reported that the development team is currently working on a new product that is expected to be released next month. Additionally, the design team is finalizing plans for a new boutique that will be opening in CRIPPLE CREEK, CO later this year.

In conclusion, the attendees discussed future plans and goals for the company. It was decided that a budget should be allocated for the new marketing strategies, and the development team should continue to focus on creating innovative products to stay ahead of the competition.
