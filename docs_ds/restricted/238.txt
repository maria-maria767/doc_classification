Dear Employees,

I am writing to inform you of a new security protocol that we will be implementing company-wide. As you may be aware, our company has been experiencing an increase in cyber attacks, and it is my top priority to ensure the safety and security of our employees and client data.

To address this, we will be implementing a two-factor authentication system for all company accounts, including email and remote access. This will provide an additional layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Please be on the lookout for an email from our IT department with instructions on how to set up this new authentication method.

Additionally, I urge all employees to be mindful of phishing scams and to never provide personal or company information to unverified sources. If you ever suspect that you have received a suspicious email or are unsure of the legitimacy of a request, please contact the IT department immediately.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
