This report provides an in-depth analysis of the current security measures in place at the premises of Mechanical & Electrical Fixings Ltd., located at 1 Kings Court, Fairmount, 13031 New York. This evaluation encompasses physical security, information security, and personnel security measures.

**2. Physical Security Overview**

During the review period, several spot checks were conducted at various access points around the facility. All security systems, including CCTVs, motion sensors, and access control mechanisms, were found to be fully operational. A drill was conducted, simulating a breach, and the response protocol was successfully followed by the on-site team. Adjustments to patrol routes were made to enhance coverage, especially in the warehouse section.

**3. Information Security**

A review of our information security protocols has been completed. All computers and devices are equipped with the latest anti-virus software and firewalls. Email communications are encrypted, with regular scrutiny to ensure only authorized personnel are privy to sensitive information. It is recommended that additional training sessions on cybersecurity best practices be scheduled for all staff.

**4. Personnel Security Measures**

Each employee has undergone the necessary background checks before hiring, in compliance with company policy. A refresher course on the importance of confidentiality and restricted information handling has been scheduled for the upcoming quarter. Employees have signed a non-disclosure agreement and are consistently reminded of the sensitivity of the information they handle.

**5. Incident Report**

There was a single security incident involving unauthorized access to a company email account, namely harmony.brown@wilson-shelton.site. Immediate action was taken to secure the account, and an in-depth investigation is ongoing. Preliminary findings suggest this was an isolated occurrence with no data compromise.

**6. Recommendations**

- Increase the frequency of unannounced security checks.
- Implement a two-factor authentication system for all company email accounts.
- Conduct a thorough security audit every six months.
- Update emergency response and evacuation procedures.
