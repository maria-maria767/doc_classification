[Pixel House Internal Memorandum]

TO: Mislav Stassov, Project Manager
FROM: Jackson Kirce, Senior Analyst
DATE: March 30, 2023
SUBJECT: Mantova Project Data Analysis Update

Dear Mislav,

I am writing this memorandum to update you on the recent findings from the data analysis conducted for our ongoing project in Mantova. The information contained within this document is of a sensitive nature and should only be circulated among the designated personnel listed in the Project Access Control List (PACL).

Key Findings:
1. We have identified three potential risk factors that could impact project delivery timelines. These risks are chiefly associated with the unpredictable regulations in the local Mantova market.
2. Our research indicates that there may be an opportunity to optimize our cost structure by approximately 17% through the re-negotiation of supply chain contracts with local vendors.

Action Items:
- Assess the feasibility of adjusting project scope to mitigate identified risks without affecting the deliverables.
- Initiate discussions with the procurement team to approach vendors for re-negotiation of terms.

Next Steps:
I recommend scheduling a meeting with the risk management team for the first week of April to formulate a detailed risk mitigation strategy. Additionally, convene with the procurement department to set clear objectives for vendor negotiations.

Sensitive Information (*):
Please note that our local contact in Mantova, Deniz O'Brien of Andrew Technologies, has provided us with insider projections for Q3 and Q4 which could affect our market strategy. This information is to remain strictly confidential and is not to be discussed outside of the designated PAQL.

Conclusion:
The progress on the Mantova project is promising. Our current data analysis has provided us with actionable insights, and with swift, coordinated action, we can leverage these findings to enhance the project's success.

Please ensure all discussions related to this update adhere to our strict confidentiality protocols.

Best regards,

Jackson Kirce
Senior Analyst
