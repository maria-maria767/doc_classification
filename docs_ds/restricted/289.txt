Subject: Company Restructuring Plan

As we continue to grow and expand our operations, it has become necessary to restructure our company to ensure greater efficiency and productivity. This memorandum outlines the key changes that will be implemented over the next few months.

1. Departmental Reorganization: We will be restructuring our departments to create more streamlined and focused teams. The new structure will be as follows:
* Department A: Alexander, Mirče Stanojevski Carlos
* Department B: Belevski
* Department C: Hendrik Skaggs Nelms
2. Reporting Lines: All employees will report to their respective department heads. Department heads will report to the Vice President of Operations, who will report to the CEO.
3. Job Descriptions: Each employee will receive a new job description outlining their roles and responsibilities within the restructured departments.
4. Training: All employees will receive training on the new departmental structure, reporting lines, and job descriptions.
5. Communication: Open and transparent communication will be key to the success of this restructuring plan. Employees are encouraged to speak with their department heads or HR if they have any questions or concerns.

This restructuring plan is considered a restricted document, and access to it is limited to authorized employees only. If you have any questions or concerns, please speak with your department head or HR representative.

Sincerely,
CEO
