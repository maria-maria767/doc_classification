Subject: New Project Initiative

Dear Employees,

As we continue to expand our business, we have identified a new project initiative that holds great potential for our company. Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of this project, we can only share the details with a limited number of people. For this reason, we have restricted access to this document to only those employees who are directly involved in the project.

The project involves the development of a new product line that will require significant investments in research and development, as well as the coordination of various departments within the company. As such, we are looking for volunteers who are interested in being a part of this exciting new venture.

If you are interested in participating in this project, please contact Subhan Ieuan Wallace Lowe, our Senior Project Manager, at [j.smiley358@gmail.com](mailto:j.smiley358@gmail.com) or 4312059769. We will be conducting an initial screening process to ensure that only those employees who are highly qualified and committed to the success of this project are selected.

Thank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to working together on this exciting new initiative.

Sincerely,
Mislav Stassov
CEO, Mesit holding, a.s.
