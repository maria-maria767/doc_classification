Subject: Implementation of New Security Protocols

Dear Mr. Velizar,

In response to the recent review of our company's security posture and the need to enhance the protection of our sensitive business operations, I am writing to inform you of the new security protocols that will be effective immediately.

- Access Control Enhancements: Access to the research and development wing will be limited to authorized personnel only. Company identification badges must be worn at all times, and a new biometric scanning system will be put in place starting next Monday.

- Data Protection Measures: All sensitive data, including project documents and client information, must be transmitted through the company's encrypted email service. Please refrain from using the following personal email addresses for any company-related correspondence: jmarler2156@gmail.com, j-grasso8323@wilson.site, l.f@simunic.com.hr.

- Communication Security: Discussion of any company-sensitive matters is to be conducted within secured locations only—either within designated secure rooms at our facility or encrypted teleconference calls. Personal phones should be used only in emergencies and must not be used for discussing or transmitting restricted information.

- Document Handling: All documents classified as "Restricted" are to be securely stored in locked cabinets when not in use and must be shredded using a cross-cut shredder when disposal is required.

In your capacity as Lead Project Manager, your adherence to these protocols is critical. Please ensure your team receives thorough briefings on these changes and that compliance is enforced.

A detailed document outlining all changes and protocols will be distributed at the briefing next week. Please make sure all team members attend.

For reservations regarding the secure location for the briefing or for answers to any queries, contact me directly at the following:
Phone: (061) 7044 8995
Email: [Redacted for security reasons]

It is imperative that all communication regarding this matter is treated with the highest level of discretion.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter and your continued cooperation in ensuring the security of our organization's operations.

Best Regards,

Duča Grabowsky Peco
Regional Security Manager
