Subject: Changes in Company Policies Regarding Vacation Time

As many of you are aware, we have recently restructured our company policies in order to better accommodate the needs of our employees. One of the changes we have made is to our vacation time policy. Please find below a summary of the new policy:

* All employees are entitled to 21 days of paid vacation per year.
* Vacation days can be taken in increments of one day, with a maximum of four weeks allowed at a time.
* Vacation requests must be submitted at least two weeks in advance and must be approved by the employee's supervisor.
* Vacation days cannot be carried over from one year to the next, and any unused days will be forfeited.

We hope that these changes will provide our employees with more flexibility and autonomy in managing their time off. If you have any questions or concerns about these policies, please do not hesitate to reach out to your supervisor or HR representative.

Thank you,

Mark
