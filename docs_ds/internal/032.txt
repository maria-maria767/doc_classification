**MEMO**

TO: All Department Heads
FROM: Viktor Dodos Dimitrij – Chief Operations Officer
DATE: April 1, 2023
SUBJECT: Updated Office Supply Requisition Process

Dear Team Leaders,

As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline internal operations and manage expenditures, we are implementing a revised office supply requisition process effective immediately. This memo aims to provide you with an overview of the new procedures to ensure compliance and efficiency within our internal operations at Meteksan Savunma Sanayii A.Ş.

**New Requisition Protocol**

1. **Requisition Form**:
   - All requests for office supplies must be made using the updated requisition form, which is now available on the company intranet. This form must be filled out in its entirety, providing details about the supplies needed, the quantity, and the intended use.

2. **Approval**:
   - Department heads must approve all requisition forms before submission. Please, review your department’s needs thoroughly before granting your approval.

3. **Submission**:
   - Completed forms should be submitted electronically to the Supplies Management Department at supplies@meteksan.com.tr no later than the 15th of each month.

4. **Budget**:
   - Every department has been allocated a monthly budget for office supplies. Please, ensure that your requisition does not exceed this amount. Should you require additional funds, a separate request must be made with a detailed explanation.

5. **Delivery**:
   - Deliveries will be made within five working days from the date of approval by the Supplies Management Department. In case of urgent needs, please contact the department directly at extension 10940/ 46 479.

Your cooperation with the implementation of this new process is essential. It will not only help us to control costs but also maintain an adequate stock of office supplies to prevent any disruptions in our daily operations.

Should you have any questions regarding the new process or require training for your team on filling out the requisition forms, please reach out to Kairi Claudia Nemeth, Supply Chain Manager, at kairi.nemeth@meteksan.com.tr or call her at +1-025-621-8280.

I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and your commitment to assisting us in optimizing our resources efficiently.

Best regards,

Viktor Dodos Dimitrij
Chief Operations Officer
