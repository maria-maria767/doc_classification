Subject: New Sales Strategy for Q2

Dear Team,

As we move into the second quarter of this year, it's time to take a closer look at our sales strategy and see how we can improve our results. Based on the success we've had with our recent marketing campaigns, I believe we should focus more on targeting small businesses in the Forlì-Cesena and Lecco areas.

To do this, we'll need to create customized sales pitches for each business based on their specific needs and pain points. We should also consider offering special promotions or discounts to encourage them to try our products.

To help with this, we'll be adding a new member to our sales team. Spas Hospod Ricardo will be joining us from Umaqia agency and will be responsible for reaching out to these small businesses and building relationships with them.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this new strategy. I'm confident that with the right approach, we can significantly increase our sales for the rest of the year.

Best regards,

Kotsios
