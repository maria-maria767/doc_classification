TimeKeeper Plus Features:
- Automated time-tracking with precise reporting
- Integration with our existing HR management systems
- Mobile app availability for remote or traveling employees
- Real-time productivity analytics and forecasting tools

Action Required:
1. Department Heads are requested to attend a mandatory training session on using and managing TimeKeeper Plus. Details on the venue and schedule will be communicated by April 10, 2023.
2. After the training, Department Heads will ensure that all team members within their department are briefed and prepared for the transition.
3. IT department will help in installation, setup, and addressing any technical issues during the rollout phase.

Confidentiality and Data Handling:
Please be reminded that although this document is marked for internal diffusion, the data contained within TimeKeeper Plus is confidential and should be accessed only by authorized personnel. It is crucial that all members are made aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of this data as per our internal data privacy policies.

We value your insights and feedback on the new software. A review meeting will be scheduled for late June after the software has been in use for several weeks, to discuss any challenges or suggestions for improvement.

We appreciate your cooperation in making this transition smooth and effective. For any questions or concerns, please reach out to the Project Lead, Janet Armstrong, or your respective supervisor.
