**MEMORANDUM**

To: All Department Managers  
From: Jane Doe, HR Director  
Date: April 10, 2023  
Subject: Updated Work-From-Home Policy

---

**Background**

In light of recent assessments of our work-from-home arrangements, and in conjunction with the feedback received from staff and management, we have decided to update our existing work-from-home policy to better reflect the current needs of our team and our organization's operational capabilities.

**Policy Changes**

Effective immediately, the following changes have been integrated into our work-from-home (WFH) policy:

1. **Eligibility**: All full-time employees who have completed their probation period are now eligible to apply for WFH arrangements, subject to departmental approval and operational needs.

2. **Scheduling**: Employees with approved WFH status may work from home up to two days per week. The specific days should be consistent each week and agreed upon with their line manager to ensure operational continuity.

3. **Communication**: Employees working from home are expected to be available during standard working hours via email, instant messaging, and phone. The use of video conferencing for meetings is encouraged to maintain team cohesion.

4. **Performance Management**: Work-from-home arrangements will be assessed on a quarterly basis. Continued eligibility will be contingent upon meeting all performance metrics as if the employee were on-site.

5. **Data Security**: Employees are reminded that all company data must be handled in accordance with our data protection policies. Secure connections must be used at all times, and sensitive information must not be printed or accessed on public or unsecured networks.

6. **Equipment and Reimbursements**: The company will provide necessary equipment such as laptops and headsets. A stipend may be available to cover partial costs for home internet upgrades, if required for work purposes, upon submission of valid receipts.

**Implementation**

Departments are responsible for the implementation of the updated policy and ensuring that all team members are aware of the changes. Managers must maintain records of all WFH arrangements and monitor compliance with the revised policy.

**Questions**

Any questions regarding the updated WFH policy should be directed to the HR Department.
