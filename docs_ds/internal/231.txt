MEMORANDUM

Date: May 12, 2023
To: All Employees
From: Mark
Subject: Changes in Company Policies

As we continue to grow and evolve, it is important that we update our company policies to ensure they align with our current needs and goals. Following a thorough review, I am pleased to announce the following changes:

1. Vacation Policy: We understand the importance of our employees taking time off to recharge and spend time with their loved ones. As such, we have updated our vacation policy to allow for more flexible paid time off. Employees may now request up to four weeks of paid vacation per year, with approval granted on a case-by-case basis.
2. Work-from-Home Policy: To promote a better work-life balance, we are introducing a new work-from-home policy. Employees are now allowed to work from home up to two days per week, as long as they have a reliable internet connection and necessary equipment.
3. Professional Development Budget: We believe in investing in the growth and development of our employees. As such, we have increased the professional development budget to $500 per year, per employee. This can be used for training, courses, conferences, or other approved professional development opportunities.
4. Flexible Work Hours: To accommodate employees' personal needs, we are implementing a flexible work hours policy. Employees may now choose their desired start and end times, as long as they work the required 40 hours per week and maintain a consistent schedule.
5. Mental Health Support: We are committed to supporting our employees' mental health. We have partnered with a local mental health provider to offer confidential counseling sessions for all employees and their family members.

Please note that these changes will take effect on June 1, 2023. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to the HR department.

Thank you for your continued dedication to our company.

Sincerely,

Mark
CEO, Cameron Parker Hiller
