Policy and Procedure: Social Media Use

Introduction:
This policy outlines the guidelines for employees of our organization to follow when using social media. Social media can be a powerful tool for promoting our brand and building relationships with our customers, but it is important that we use it responsibly.

Scope:

Guidelines:

1. Employees must use their personal social media accounts when posting about the company or its products. They must make it clear that their views are their own and not those of the company.
2. Employees must obtain prior approval from their supervisor before posting anything that could be perceived as representative of the company or its views.
3. Employees must refrain from posting any confidential or sensitive information about the company or its clients on social media.
4. Employees must not engage in any online behavior that may be viewed as discriminatory, harassing, or offensive.
5. Employees must immediately notify their supervisor if they become aware of any posts or comments that violate these guidelines.

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
