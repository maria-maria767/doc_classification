Product Description:
The EcoFly Hybrid Air Purifier is an innovative product designed to improve the air quality in your home or office. With cutting-edge technology, it combines the benefits of both mechanical and natural air purification methods to provide you with a healthier living or working environment.

Product Features:

1. Three-Stage Filtration System: The EcoFly Hybrid Air Purifier is equipped with a pre-filter, an activated carbon filter, and a HEPA filter. These three stages work together to capture particles as small as 0.3 microns, including pollen, dust, and pet dander.
2. Energy-Efficient Design: The air purifier is powered by a rechargeable battery or an AC adapter, allowing you to use it in any room without worrying about cords or power outlets. Additionally, it automatically adjusts its fan speed based on the air quality, saving energy when it's not needed.
3. Smart Sensor: The EcoFly Hybrid Air Purifier comes with a built-in smart sensor that monitors the air quality in real-time, adjusting its fan speed and filter replacement schedule accordingly. You can also control it via the accompanying mobile app.
4. Compact and Portable: Measuring only 11x6x6 inches and weighing 4.4 pounds, the air purifier is easy to move from room to room or take with you when traveling.
5. Eco-Friendly: The product is made from sustainable materials and is designed to minimize its carbon footprint. The activated carbon filter can be replaced with a reusable one, reducing waste and further emphasizing the product's eco-friendliness.

Maintenance and Replacement:

The EcoFly Hybrid Air Purifier's filters should be replaced every 6-12 months, depending on the air quality and usage. The pre-filter and activated carbon filter can be replaced separately, while the HEPA filter should be replaced as a whole unit. To ensure the purifier continues to operate efficiently, regularly vacuum or brush the exterior of the device to remove any loose particles.

The EcoFly Hybrid Air Purifier comes with a 1-year limited warranty, covering defects in materials and workmanship. For any issues or inquiries, please contact our customer support team at [customersupport@ecofly.com](mailto:customersupport@ecofly.com) or (474) 923-1488.
