INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

To: All Department Heads
From: Chief Operations Officer
Date: April 1, 2023
Subject: Implementation of Quarterly Performance Reviews

-------------------

Background:

As part of our ongoing commitment to excellence and continuous improvement, we are instituting a new system for evaluating employee performance. The objective is to foster a culture of feedback and development, aligning individual goals with our company's strategic objectives.

Implementation:

The new Quarterly Performance Review (QPR) program will commence in Q2 2023. Under this system, each employee will engage in a structured review session with their immediate supervisor to assess progress, set goals, and discuss professional development opportunities.

The elements of the QPR will include:

1. Review of performance against objectives from the previous quarter.
2. Discussion of any barriers to performance and strategies for overcoming these challenges.
3. Establishment of clear and measurable objectives for the upcoming quarter.
4. Identification of training and development needs.
5. A feedback mechanism for employees to share their thoughts on their role, team dynamics, and workplace environment.

Training and Resources:

All supervisors will receive training on how to conduct effective performance reviews and set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) objectives. Human Resources will facilitate these training sessions and provide supporting documentation.

Additionally, an online portal will be established where employees and supervisors can access QPR forms, procedure manuals, and track their upcoming review schedules.

Confidentiality:

While QPRs are designed for transparent and open dialogue between employees and supervisors, the content of these discussions and any related documentation are considered sensitive and for internal use only. Unauthorized sharing of review materials outside of the intended parties is strictly prohibited.

Action Plan:

- HR to finalize QPR materials and schedule training sessions by April 15.
- Department Heads to ensure all supervisors within their teams are enrolled for the training.
- IT to develop and test the online QPR portal, aiming for launch on April 30.
- A pilot review session will take place in a selected department by the end of May to refine the process before company-wide rollout.

Conclusion:

The QPR program is integral for maintaining our high standards of performance and supporting our employees' professional growth. We count on your collaboration and adherence to the implementation timeline to achieve a successful launch. Please communicate this new process to your teams effectively and ensure full participation.

For any queries or suggestions, please reach out to the HR department.

Thank you for your attention and cooperation.
