Re: Q1 2023 Sales Performance

I hope this message finds you all well. As we close out the first quarter of 2023, I would like to take a moment to reflect on our sales performance and acknowledge the hard work that has gone into achieving our goals.

Overall, I am pleased to report that our sales have exceeded expectations for the quarter. We have seen significant growth in both new and existing customer accounts, and our sales team has done an outstanding job in closing deals and maintaining strong relationships with our clients.

Special recognition goes out to Stoyan Tsarknias Kirce, who has consistently delivered exceptional results and has been instrumental in driving sales in the Eastern Europe region. His dedication and hard work have not gone unnoticed, and I am grateful for his contributions to the team.

As we move into the second quarter, I encourage each member of the sales team to continue pushing forward and striving for excellence. Let's keep up the great work and aim to meet or surpass our sales targets for the year.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me directly. Thank you for your hard work, and let's make Q2 a success!

Best regards,
Ludmila Sadowsky Danica
