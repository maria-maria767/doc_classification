INTERNAL MEMO
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO: All Department Heads
FROM: Radivoje Rybakov Zharko, Chief Operating Officer
DATE: April 15, 2023
SUBJECT: Quarterly Resource Allocation and Cost Savings Measures

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Team,

This memorandum is being circulated to review our current resource allocation and to institute new measures aimed at optimizing our operations for cost savings. This is a priority directive and strictly for internal diffusion, as it contains sensitive details about our company strategies.

1. Allocation of Technical Resources:

We have been examining our technical department's utilization of resources in Q1 and noticed a trend of underutilization during off-peak periods. To better align our resources with demand, we will be implementing a flexible working schedule for our technical staff that should reduce our overhead by 10% while maintaining operational efficiency. Team leads are expected to present their flexible scheduling plans by April 30, 2023.

2. Reduction of Redundant Software Licenses:

An audit conducted by Syntego IT Solution LLP has identified that we have multiple redundant software licenses that are unnecessarily incurring expenses. By centralizing our software needs and negotiating enterprise licenses, we aim to cut down on individual software costs by 20%. The IT department will coordinate this effort and provide a transition plan by May 15, 2023.

3. Optimization of Office Spaces:

Considering the remote work trend, we find our current office space at Kälvestavägen, Stockholm, Sverige slightly underutilized. We propose a sublease of one floor to City Front Realty Group, which should reduce our rental costs significantly while maintaining adequate office space for our operations. The Legal Department is tasked with drafting the necessary contract, ensuring compliance with local legislation, and coordinating with Real Estate to finalize this sublease agreement by June 1, 2023.

4. Review of Supplier Contracts:

We are also looking into our existing contracts with suppliers to identify potential areas for cost savings. Our Procurement Division is requested to prepare a comprehensive review of all major contracts, with a focus on renegotiating terms or possibly sourcing alternative suppliers that meet our criteria for cost, quality, and delivery times. A preliminary report with actionable recommendations should be ready for discussion in our Q2 planning meeting.

Confidentiality Notice:

Sincerely,
