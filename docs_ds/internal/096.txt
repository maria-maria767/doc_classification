Subject: New Sales Strategy for Q2

Dear Team,

I am excited to announce our new sales strategy for the second quarter of the year. Based on our recent market research and customer feedback, we have identified a new target audience and a more effective approach to reach them.

Our new target audience is small and medium-sized businesses in the technology industry. To reach them, we will focus on digital marketing channels such as social media, search engine optimization, and email marketing. We will also attend relevant industry conferences and events to network and build relationships with potential customers.

To implement this new strategy, we will be allocating additional resources to our marketing team and hiring a dedicated sales representative for the technology industry. We will also be providing additional training to our existing sales team to ensure they are equipped to sell to this new audience.

I am confident that this new sales strategy will help us achieve our quarterly and annual sales goals, and I look forward to working with all of you to make it a success.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
