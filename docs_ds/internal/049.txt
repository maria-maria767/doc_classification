Subject: Implementation of New Internal Communication Platform

PURPOSE:

The purpose of this memorandum is to inform you of the imminent implementation of a new internal communication platform designed to improve efficiency and collaboration within our company.

BACKGROUND:

As our company continues to grow, it is imperative that our communication methods evolve to meet the dynamic needs of our business. After extensive research and several pilot tests, the executive team has selected 'ConnectUs' as our new company-wide communication platform.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

The 'ConnectUs' platform will officially replace our current email system and will become the primary means of internal communication starting May 15, 2023. The features of 'ConnectUs' include:

- Direct messaging and group conversations
- Project collaboration spaces with shared documents and timelines
- Video conferencing and screen sharing capabilities
- Company announcement boards
- Mobile app for remote access

TRAINING SCHEDULE:

To ensure a seamless transition, a phased training approach will be conducted as follows:

- 'ConnectUs' Champions Training: April 10-12, 2023
- Management Training: April 17-19, 2023
- Department Staff Training: April 24-30, 2023

Each department must nominate two 'ConnectUs' Champions to lead the training within their department.

DATA MIGRATION:

IT department will oversee the secure migration of all current projects, archives, and relevant databases to 'ConnectUs'. The migration will occur between May 1-10, 2023. It is crucial that all departments perform a thorough review of their data and back up important files before the migration date.

ACTION ITEMS:

1. Nominate your department 'ConnectUs' Champions by April 7, 2023.
