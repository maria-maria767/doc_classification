MEMORANDUM

Date: April 12, 2023
To: All Employees
From: Gjurićik, CEO
Subject: Internal Document Classification Policy

As we continue to grow and expand our organization, it is important that we maintain the confidentiality and security of our internal documents. To ensure this, we are implementing a new document classification policy.

All internal documents must be classified as either "Internal" or "Confidential". Internal documents are for internal use only and should not be shared with anyone outside of the organization. Confidential documents are protected and sensitive, with restricted access only to authorized employees.

It is important to note that any unauthorized distribution or sharing of confidential documents may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

Please familiarize yourself with the new policy and ensure that all documents you create or receive are appropriately classified. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the HR department.

Sincerely,
Gjurićik, CEO
