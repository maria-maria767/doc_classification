Subject: New Sales Strategy for Q2

Dear Maria, Killian, and Nelson,

I hope this email finds you well. As we enter the second quarter of the year, we need to review our sales strategy to ensure that we meet our quarterly targets. After reviewing our performance in Q1, I have identified a few areas of improvement that I would like to discuss with all of you.

Firstly, I would like to propose that we focus on expanding our customer base by targeting new markets. We have been doing business with the same customers for a while now, and it is time that we explore new opportunities. I suggest that we start by identifying potential customers in Forlì-Cesena and Cremona, and then move on to other cities like Huesca. We can use the contact details of our existing customers to find potential leads in these locations.

Secondly, I would like to introduce a new sales approach that we have been testing in our pilot markets. This approach involves identifying key decision-makers in potential customer organizations and then building relationships with them. We have found that this approach has been highly effective in closing deals, and I think we should implement it across all our markets.

Lastly, I would like to remind everyone about the importance of following up with potential customers after we have made a sale. We have noticed that some of our sales reps are not following up with customers regularly, which can lead to lost opportunities in the long run. I would like to request that everyone makes an effort to stay in touch with our customers and provide them with the support they need.

Please let me know your thoughts on these proposals, and we can schedule a meeting to discuss them in more detail.

Best regards,

Killian
