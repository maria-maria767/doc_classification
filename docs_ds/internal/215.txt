Subject: Coordination of Upcoming Marketing Campaign for vertepac | toto carrying systems bv

Dear Killian,

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the progress of the marketing campaign for our latest product line with vertepac | toto carrying systems bv. I would like to remind you that the information contained in this email is intended for internal dissemination within Seman Baker only.

Firstly, I would like to commend you on the initial draft of the campaign strategy that you shared. Maria from the design team has proposed some adjustments to the visuals that I believe could enhance our messaging. We aim for the revised visuals to be ready for review at the team meeting next Tuesday. Please ensure that the creative brief reflects these updates.

Additionally, I have scheduled a meeting with the Exittolive representatives to finalize the co-branding details. The meeting will take place at our Alfonsine office located at Via Aurelio Saffi rd. on number 22e, Emilia-Romagna state on April 15, 2023. Your presence is crucial to ensure alignment between all parties. I believe your insight will be invaluable, especially considering your prior successful collaboration with Exittolive on the 'Innovate for Nature' initiative.

Furthermore, I suggest that we continue using the project management platform to track our progress. Should you have any immediate concerns or require assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me at scann@shepard-reed.com or call me directly at +57 61 1794 0104.

Lastly, I would like to reiterate the importance of keeping all campaign details and discussions within the confines of the company. It is imperative that no information should be disclosed to external parties without express permission from our management team.

Thank you for your ongoing commitment to the project. I look forward to your contributions in the coming weeks as we ramp up our efforts for a successful campaign launch.

Best regards,

Nelson
