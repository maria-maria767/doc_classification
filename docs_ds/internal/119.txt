Subject: New Sales Strategy for Q2

Dear Maria, Killian, and Nelson,

I hope this email finds you well. After reviewing our sales performance over the past quarter, I would like to propose a new sales strategy for the upcoming quarter.

Our main focus will be on expanding our customer base in the Emilia-Romagna region. We will be targeting small and medium-sized businesses in the following cities: Forlì-Cesena, Alfonsine, and Cremona. Our marketing team will be reaching out to potential clients via email and phone to introduce our products and services.

Additionally, we will be hosting a series of webinars to educate our target audience on the benefits of our offerings. These webinars will be led by our sales team and will focus on showcasing our unique selling points.

To ensure the success of this strategy, I would like to assign each of you to a specific region. Maria, you will be responsible for the Forlì-Cesena region, Killian will oversee the Alfonsine area, and Nelson will focus on Cremona.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I am excited to see the positive impact this new strategy will have on our sales performance.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
