To: All Department Heads  
From: Dicho Avramov Jacob, Chief Operating Officer  
Date: April 17, 2023  
Subject: Revised Staff Work-From-Home Policy Implementation

Dear Team,

As a part of our ongoing efforts to optimize operational efficiency while maintaining a healthy work-life balance for our employees, we have revised our Work-From-Home (WFH) policy. This memorandum outlines the key components of the new WFH policy which are to be disseminated to your respective teams by April 24, 2023. 

**1. WFH Eligibility and Frequency:**
Effective immediately, all staff members who have completed their probationary period and are not required to perform critical on-site functions are eligible to work from home for up to two days per week. Eligibility is subject to supervisor approval and may be revoked in the event of a decline in work performance.

**2. Technology and Security:**
Staff are responsible for ensuring that their home office meets the minimum technical and security requirements as set by First Administrators, Inc. This includes a secure internet connection, company-approved antivirus software, and adherence to our data privacy protocols.

**3. Communication:**
On WFH days, employees must be contactable via email and phone during standard working hours. Urgent communication should be relayed through the phone number 11469/ 17 233 for immediate attention.

**4. Reporting:**
Employees are required to submit a brief end-of-day report on work performed to their direct supervisors. This measure will assist in tracking productivity and provide transparency.

**5. Meetings and Collaboration:**
Regularly scheduled meetings are expected to proceed as planned, with remote employees joining via teleconference. Use of the company's licensed video-conferencing platform is mandatory for participation.

**6. Implementation Monitoring:**
The HR department of First Administrations, Inc. will monitor the implementation of this policy. Staff feedback will be collected after a three-month trial period to determine necessary adjustments.

Please ensure that your teams are fully briefed on these policy changes and understand the expectations therein. Encourage employees to contact HR at sanja.matosic5@zagreb.hr or call 5624232106 for clarifications.

Thank you for your cooperation in the smooth transition to this revised policy. Together, we can create a flexible and productive work environment tailored to the evolving needs of our staff and our organization.

Kind Regards,
