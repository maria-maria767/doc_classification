From: Ludmila Sadowsky Danica, VP of Sales

Purpose: Review of Q1 sales performance and future projections

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and spirits. As we enter the second quarter of the year, I would like to take a moment to review our sales performance over the past three months.

As per our internal data, we have achieved a total revenue of $1,500,000 in Q1, surpassing our quarterly target by 10%. I am pleased to say that all regions have contributed significantly to this growth, with the Americas region leading the way.

Our focus on customer engagement across channels has borne fruit, and we have seen a notable increase in the number of leads generated through our digital campaigns. Our customer retention rate has also improved, thanks to the efforts of our account management team.

Moving forward, we have set an ambitious target of $2,000,000 for Q2. To achieve this, we need to maintain our momentum and focus on key growth areas. I urge you all to continue working diligently and collaboratively to meet our goals.

Please find attached the Q1 sales report for your review. If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to me or your respective managers.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication.

Warm regards,

Ludmila Sadowsky Danica
