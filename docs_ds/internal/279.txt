Subject: New Employee Orientation Program

Dear All,

We are excited to announce the launch of our new employee orientation program. This program is designed to help new employees quickly become productive and integrated into our organization.

The orientation program will consist of two parts: an online module and an in-person session. The online module will cover company policies, procedures, and culture, while the in-person session will provide an opportunity for new employees to meet their colleagues, ask questions, and receive a tour of our facilities.

The online module will be mandatory for all new employees and must be completed before their first day of work. The in-person session will be held on the first Friday of every month, and attendance is strongly encouraged.

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns about the new orientation program. We are excited to welcome our new employees and help them succeed in their new roles.

Best regards,

Dicho Avramov Jacob
