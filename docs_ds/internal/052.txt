**INTERNAL MEMO**

To: All Employees of Enviro-Stewards Inc.

From: Letha Andreev, Director of Operations

Subject: Implementation of New Waste Reduction Strategies

Date: February 15, 2023

---

As Enviro-Stewards Inc. continues to lead in environmental consultancy services, we are pleased to announce the implementation of new waste reduction strategies aimed at enhancing our operational sustainability. The following strategies will take effect immediately and are applicable at all our facilities, including our headquarters located at Concord Street, Gloucester, Massachusetts.

**New Waste Reduction Strategies:**

1. **Increased Recycling Measures**: All offices must now segregate waste into organic, recyclables, and non-recyclables. Ensuring that recyclables such as paper, plastic, and metal are properly disposed of in the designated bins will assist in reducing landfill contributions.

2. **Reduction of Paper Use**: Limiting the use of paper within our operations will not only cut costs but also contribute to conserving forests. We encourage all staff to print only when necessary and to utilize double-sided printing to minimize paper usage.

3. **Composting**: Our Gloucester office will start a composting program for organic waste. This initiative will serve as a pilot program to be evaluated and potentially rolled out company-wide.

4. **Sustainable Commuting**: Employees are urged to consider carpooling, public transport, or other sustainable commuting methods to reduce carbon emissions. Regional offices, including those in MINEOLA, NY, and Ancash, are requested to facilitate and encourage this initiative.

5. **Energy Conservation**: All departments are asked to make a conscious effort to conserve energy by turning off lights and electronic devices when not in use, especially outside of business hours.

**Responsibilities:**

To facilitate the adoption of these strategies, the following individuals are appointed as Sustainability Officers for their respective departments:

- Ancash Office: Panayot Karanov Richard – Sustainability Officer
- MINEOLA, NY Office: An appointed officer will be announced following the local committee meeting scheduled next week.

**Compliance & Reporting:**

All departments must provide a monthly report on their sustainability efforts and waste reduction outcomes to the Sustainability Committee headed by Letha Andreev. The first report is due on March 31, 2023. Kindly send your reports to the provided email: l.bravo746@gmail.com.

**Contact Information:**

For further inquiries or to provide feedback on the implementation process, please reach out to our dedicated hotline at (0800) 20 21 or send an email to Letha Andreev directly.

**Please Note:**

This memo is intended for all staff members of Enviro-Stewards Inc. and should not be shared outside of the organization. Your cooperation and active participation in these sustainability efforts are essential for our success in reducing our environmental footprint.

Thank you for your continued dedication to environmental excellence.

Sincerely,
