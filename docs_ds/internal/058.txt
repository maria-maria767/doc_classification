Date: April 5, 2023
Subject: Quarterly Environmental Impact Assessment Proposal

Dear Sebastian,

I am writing to submit a formal proposal for the environmental impact assessment for the upcoming project that Vbg Engineering - India is set to commence in the third quarter of this year.

**Project Overview:**
The project involves the construction of a new manufacturing facility at 296 Pequonnock Street, Bridgeport 06604, Connecticut. Given the scale of the construction and its potential environmental impact, an in-depth assessment must be initiated well in advance.

**Assessment Objectives:**
- To identify and evaluate potential environmental impacts associated with the construction activities.
- To propose mitigation strategies for any significant negative impacts identified.
- To ensure compliance with local environmental regulations and laws.

**Proposed Assessment Phases:**
1. Data Collection and Analysis: Our team, led by project manager Kreso Lovrić Zdravko, will collect data on the local flora, fauna, air quality, water quality, and soil condition.
2. Impact Prediction: Using modeling software, we will predict changes in environmental parameters during and post-construction.
3. Mitigation Strategies: We will develop a comprehensive plan to mitigate unavoidable impacts through technology and process modification.

**Team and Contact Information:**
Project Manager: Kreso Lovrić Zdravko

The timeline for the completion of the environmental impact assessment is tentatively set for 60 days post-approval of this proposal.
