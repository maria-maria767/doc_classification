Dear Team Members,

This memorandum is to remind and outline the steps required for the upcoming monthly performance reviews. Please note that the contents of this memorandum and the attached documents are considered for internal diffusion only and should not be shared outside of Rush Express.

**1. Self-Assessment Submission:**
All employees are required to complete their self-assessment form by the 5th of the upcoming month. Please ensure you detail your accomplishments, challenges, and any training needs. This will form the basis of your performance discussion.

**2. Manager Review:**
Upon receiving the self-assessments, managers are to schedule individual meetings with their team members between the 10th and 15th of the month. Managers will complete their section of the assessment prior to this meeting.

**3. Performance Meeting:**
During the one-on-one meeting, both the manager and the employee will discuss the employee's performance, agree on objectives, and set a plan for professional development.

**4. Documentation:**
Once the performance discussion has concluded, both parties are to sign off on the final performance document. This document should then be submitted to the Human Resources department no later than the 20th of the month.

**5. Progress Tracking:**
Managers are expected to keep a confidential individual performance log to track the progress of each direct report. This log will be reviewed in future meetings and can be requested for audit purposes by HR.
