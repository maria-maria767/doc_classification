**MEMORANDUM**

To: All Staff
From: Kotsios, Umaqia Agency
Date: April 7, 2023
Subject: Implementation of New Communication Guidelines

---

As part of our ongoing commitment to ensure the efficiency and security of our internal communications, an update to the Umaqia Agency Communication Guidelines is being rolled out effective immediately. The key points of this update are outlined below.

### Email Communication

- All emails containing sensitive project information must be encrypted.
- Use the corporate email domain (@umaqia-agency.com) for all internal communications.
- For external communication, if project-sensitive information is involved, ensure to obtain prior approval from the department head.

### Phone Protocol

- Official communication with clients should be logged and brief notes on the discussion should be submitted after each call.
- For internal discussions, especially those that involve client or project details, use the secure line: +55 06 95387 0325.
  
### Addressing Client Inquiries

- Direct all client inquiries to our standard support channel: support@umaqia-agency.com. Personal email addresses (e.g., xm@cabrera.site, adesilva6@pugh-bowman.net) should not be used.
- If a client contacts directly through personal extension, please redirect them to the support team and log the interaction.

### Document Management

- All documents labeled "DIFFUSION INTERNAL" are not to be shared outside of the designated teams. 
- Ensure all documents are stored in the appropriate secure Umaqia Agency cloud folders following the newly provided classification and storage procedures.

### Inter-office Communication

- Use the intercom system for quick internal communications to minimize email clutter. 
- For sensitive discussions or meetings, book a conference room and ensure privacy measures are in place.

### Notice of Address Changes

- Any change of office address must be reported to the administration within 24 hours. Currently, the only authorized addresses are:
  - 101 Krańcowa Borowa, województwo łódzkie, 95-040
  - 39 Ledgewood Terrace, Kinnelon, New Jersey, 07405

Staff must acknowledge receipt and understanding of these updated guidelines by replying to this memorandum with "Acknowledged" and their signatures.

Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in disciplinary action. Please contact either Spas Hospod Ricardo (HR Manager) or Deliivanov (Legal Advisor) if you have any questions regarding these changes.

Thank you for your attention to this important update.
