SUBJECT: Updated Office Recycling Protocol
DATE: [Current Date]

Dear Team,

As part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, we are implementing a new recycling protocol effective immediately. This document outlines the changes and your responsibilities in ensuring compliance within your respective departments.

1. Paper Waste Management:
   - All used paper is to be deposited in the blue recycling bins.
   - Confidential documents must be shredded before recycling.

2. Plastic and Metal Recycling:
   - Rinse any plastic or metal item before placing it in the green recycling bins.
   - No plastic bags or non-recyclable plastics in the green bins.

3. Electronic Waste:
   - Deposit used batteries, ink cartridges, and small electronics in the designated e-waste storage area located at East Shore Road rd. on number 199 in Swanzey, New Hampshire state.
   - Arrange for proper disposal through our approved e-waste recycling partner, leepson bounds entertainment inc.

4. Organics:
   - Organic waste, including food scraps and compostable materials, should be placed in the brown compost bins.
   - Avoid contamination with non-organic material.

Please ensure that all staff members are informed of these protocols and understand the importance of adhering to them. We will be conducting workshops led by Granič from the Environmental Initiatives team to assist with any questions and provide further instruction where needed.

For inquiries, please contact Stoyan Tsarknias Kirce at v-perez2@evans.store or call +233559587756.

Non-adherence to these guidelines will be noted and addressed accordingly. Your cooperation is crucial in establishing a greener workplace.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Ludmila Sadowsky Danica
HR Director
