Effective May 1, 2023, our company will be adopting a new digital expense reporting system designed to streamline the submission, approval, and reimbursement processes associated with employee expenses. We have partnered with ExpensiTrack, a leading provider of expense management solutions, to deploy this new platform across all departments. This transition reflects our ongoing commitment to efficiency and fiscal responsibility.

Key Features of the New System:

- Automated expense policy compliance checks
- Real-time expense report tracking
- Direct integration with our accounting software
- Quick reimbursement processing

Action Required:
1. All department heads are required to attend a mandatory training session on April 15 or April 22. Please RSVP to the HR Department by April 5, indicating your preferred date.
2. Department heads are responsible for ensuring their team members complete the online training module by April 30.
3. Ensure that all pending expense reports under the current system are submitted and approved by April 25 to facilitate a smooth transition.

Support:
- Technical support will be provided by the IT department. Please submit any queries or issues via the internal IT support portal.
- Questions regarding policy and procedure may be directed to the Finance Department at finance@ourcompany.com.

We appreciate your cooperation in adopting this new expense reporting system. With your help, we aim to reduce processing times, increase visibility into company expenditures, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
