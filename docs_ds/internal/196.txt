Subject: Coordination of New Partnership Strategies with Exittolive

Dear Team,

I trust this message finds you well. I wish to discuss our ongoing negotiations with Exittolive, the rising player in the eco-friendly packaging solutions market. As you are aware, the potential collaboration presents an exciting opportunity for our growth strategy and market penetration.

Recent Developments:
Our most recent talks with Exittolive have been very promising. Killian from our Business Development team, reported a positive reception to our proposed joint venture, favouring our expertise and distribution network. However, before we move to the next phase, I urge the team to conduct a comprehensive review of our capacity and ensure alignment with our long-term objectives.

Action Items:
1. Maria, please draft a detailed report on our current distribution capabilities in Forlì-Cesena and Cremona, highlighting any potential scalability issues. This information is crucial for our upcoming meeting with Exittolive's executives.

2. Nelson, your task will be to liaise with the finance department by the end of the week. We need a prognostic financial model reflecting the integration of Exittolive's product line into our offerings.

3. I will coordinate with our legal team to ensure all preliminary agreements comply with the regulations of both Emilia-Romagna state and our operational policies. A preliminary draft should be ready for internal review by next Monday.

Communication Protocol:
Given the sensitivity level of our discussions, all internal communications regarding this partnership should be kept within our secured email system. Please refrain from using personal accounts or discussing the matter over unsecured channels.

Meeting Schedules:
The next round of discussions with Exittolive will be held on Thursday at Via Aurelio Saffi rd., number 22e in Alfonsine, at 10 AM. We will circulate the agenda by Wednesday COB.

Kindly confirm receipt of this message and your understanding of the tasks assigned. As always, your prompt attention and discretion in handling this matter are greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,
