From: Vasil Mončev Stoile, Director of Operations

Subject: Updated Office Recycling Procedures

Dear Team,

I am writing to inform you of the new recycling protocols that will be implemented across all departments, effective immediately. Our organization is committed to sustainable practices, and it is imperative that we all contribute to this green initiative to reduce our environmental footprint.

1. **Paper Recycling Bins**
Each department will receive designated paper recycling bins. It is important to ensure that only paper waste, such as documents, envelopes, and light cardboard, is deposited in these bins. Please make sure all paper is free of food residue or any non-paper material before recycling.

2. **Electronics and Batteries**
Electronic waste, including batteries, must be collected and stored in the specified containers located in the mailroom on 4 Otterson Road Londonderry New Hampshire 03053. Personnel from the IT department, led by Pando Daskalov Adelle, will be responsible for the disposal of electronic waste according to the city's e-waste regulations.

3. **Plastics and Metals**
Kitchen areas will now host containers for the collection of plastics and metals. Eva Radosavljević Knego, Head of Office Management, will oversee the correct separation and disposal of these materials.

4. **Confidential Documents**
All confidential documents that require disposal should not be placed in the standard recycling bins. Instead, please hand them directly to the designated department contact, Caroline Thompson at carolinethompson32@hotmail.com, or call our internal extension 4280 for the procedure on shredding and disposing of confidential materials.

5. **Recycling Training Sessions**
To assist with the transition to these new procedures, a series of mandatory training sessions will be held. The schedule will be circulated by next week for all employees to sign up. Your attendance and support in these sessions are crucial for successful implementation.

Please communicate these updates to your team members and ensure that everyone understands the importance of adherence to these new guidelines. By working together, we can make a significant difference in our environmental impact.

Thank you for your cooperation and dedication to our company’s sustainability goals. Should you have any questions or require further clarification on the new recycling protocols, do not hesitate to reach out to me directly at jacob.britt@reynolds-owen.com or call my office at 1812799437.

Let's all do our part for a greener future!

Best Regards,

Vasil Mončev Stoile
