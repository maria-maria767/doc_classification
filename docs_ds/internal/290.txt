MEMORANDUM

Date: April 17, 2023
To: All Employees
From: Elya Mirkovich Velizar, CEO
Subject: Internal Communication Protocol

As we continue to grow and expand our operations, it is essential that we maintain clear and effective communication within the organization. To that end, I am pleased to announce the implementation of a new internal communication protocol that will help us streamline our internal communications and ensure that all employees have access to the information they need to do their jobs effectively.

The new protocol will be as follows:

1. All internal communications will be sent via email to the company's internal email system. This will ensure that all employees have access to important information and updates in a timely manner.
2. Only authorized employees will have access to sensitive or confidential information. This will help us maintain the highest level of security for our protected information.
3. All employees are encouraged to share information and ideas with their colleagues to foster collaboration and innovation within the organization.
4. In case of any emergency or urgent situation, employees will be notified via the company's emergency notification system.

I would like to thank all employees for their cooperation in implementing this new protocol. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to your supervisor or HR representative.

Sincerely,
Elya Mirkovich Velizar
CEO, Blended Tech Learning
