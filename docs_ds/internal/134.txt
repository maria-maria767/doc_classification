Subject: Changes in Company Policies Regarding Vacation Time

As many of you are aware, we have recently restructured our company policies in order to better accommodate the needs of our employees. One of the changes we have made is to our vacation time policy. Please find below a summary of the new policy:

* All employees are entitled to 21 days of paid vacation per year.
* Vacation days can be taken at any time throughout the year, with the exception of certain blackout periods that will be communicated in advance.
* Unused vacation days will be paid out to employees at the end of the year.
* Employees must request vacation time at least two weeks in advance, with the exception of unforeseen circumstances.

Please note that these changes are effective immediately and apply to all employees. If you have any questions or concerns about the new policy, please do not hesitate to reach out to Dennis or Blagun Todorovski Drzislav.

Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication to our company.

Sincerely,

Mark
