MEMORANDUM

TO: All Department Heads
FROM: Kotsios Spas, Operations Manager
DATE: April 1, 2023
SUBJECT: Implementation of Enhanced Communication Protocols

Dear Colleagues,

In our continuous effort to improve inter-departmental communication and collaboration within Rush Express, the management team has decided to implement enhanced communication protocols effective as of April 15, 2023. These protocols are designed to streamline company-wide correspondence, reduce redundant processes, and increase operational efficiency.

Key Aspects of the Enhanced Communication Protocols:

1. **Centralized Communication Platform**: All internal communications will be routed through the designated platform "Umaqia agency" to ensure a unified communication channel.

2. **Weekly Departmental Updates**: Each department is required to submit a weekly update report by COB every Friday, outlining achievements, challenges, and key performance metrics. This should be emailed to xm@cabrera.site.

3. **Monthly Coordination Meetings**: We will hold mandatory monthly coordination meetings at the main office, located at 101 Krańcowa Borowa województwo łódzkie 95-040, to discuss ongoing projects and initiatives across departments.

4. **Direct Communication Lines**: In case of urgent matters, department heads may use direct communication lines provided by the operations management. Please note the updated phone contact: +55 06 95387 0325.

5. **Document Sharing and Confidentiality**: All shared documents must be marked with the appropriate sensitivity level as per our data protection policies. Internal sensitivity classification must be adhered to without exception.

Your compliance with and implementation of these protocols within your respective teams is mandatory. Please ensure that all team members are fully briefed and understand the new procedures. Training sessions will be provided where needed.

Action Required:

- Acknowledge receipt of this memorandum and confirm your understanding of the enhanced communication protocols.
- Designate a team member responsible for weekly updates and provide their contact details to Deliivanov at d.a12@turner-patterson.online no later than April 8, 2023.
- Schedule a preliminary team meeting to discuss the implications of the new protocols for your department.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me directly at 1-835-055-6217 or schedule a one-on-one meeting at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to improving our company’s communication framework.
