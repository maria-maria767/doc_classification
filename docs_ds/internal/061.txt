Subject: Guidelines for Upcoming Quarterly Performance Reviews

The purpose of this memorandum is to outline the guidelines and expectations for the upcoming quarterly performance reviews. This memo is intended for department heads and should be used to prepare review materials and conduct effective and constructive evaluation sessions with your team members.

**Preparation for Reviews:**

- **Performance Metrics:** Ensure you have all relevant performance metrics on hand for each team member. This should include sales figures, project completion rates, customer feedback scores, and any other KPIs applicable to your department.

- **Review Form:** Utilize the standardized performance review form provided by HR, which includes sections for self-assessment, supervisor assessment, goal setting, and professional development recommendations.

- **Document Compilation:** Gather any necessary supporting documents such as previous review reports, recognition letters, and any disciplinary records that need to be addressed during the review.

**Conducting the Review:**

- **Scheduling:** Schedule a private, uninterrupted meeting with each team member. Ensure that they are informed of the date and time in advance and are prepared to discuss their performance.

- **Structure:** Reviews should begin with a discussion of the team member’s self-assessment, followed by the supervisor’s assessment. Goals from the previous quarter should be reviewed, and new goals should be set for the upcoming quarter.

- **Feedback:** Provide specific examples of both positive performance and areas needing improvement. Ensure that criticism is constructive and that clear steps are outlined for any needed development.

- **Goal Setting:** Work with team members to establish realistic and challenging goals for the next quarter. Ensure these goals align with departmental objectives and overall company strategy.

**Post-Review Actions:**

- **Documentation:** Complete and sign the review form, along with the team member. Ensure that any action items or goals set during the review are clearly documented.

- **Submission:** Submit a copy of the completed review form to Human Resources within one week of the review meeting.

- **Follow-Up:** Schedule follow-up meetings as necessary to check in on progress towards goals and to provide ongoing support for each team member's professional development.

Please ensure all reviews are completed by May 31st, 2023. If you have any questions regarding the process or require additional assistance, do not hesitate to reach out to the Human Resources department.

Thank you for your cooperation and attention to detail in conducting these performance reviews.
