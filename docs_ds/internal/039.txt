**INTERNAL MEMORANDUM**

To: Cameron Parker Hiller Department Heads
From: Eva Radosavljević Knego, Operations Manager
Subject: Q2 Logistics Strategy Update
Date: April 4, 2023

**Background:**
The objective of this memorandum is to provide an outline for the updated logistics strategy for the second quarter, focused on streamlining supply chain processes and reducing operational overhead. This document should be circulated among department heads and key project managers within Cameron Parker Hiller.

**Revised Supplier Engagement Plan:**
Starting from May 1, we will be initiating a revised supplier engagement plan to improve the efficiency of our inbound logistics. The key components are as follows:
1. **Consolidation of Vendors:** We aim to decrease the number of vendors we work with by 15% without compromising the quality of goods received.

2. **Scheduled Deliveries:** To reduce warehousing costs, all deliveries must now be scheduled at least one week in advance. This protocol will be managed by Pando Daskalov Adelle from the procurement team.

3. **Local Sourcing Initiative:** Efforts will be stepped up to source 10% more materials from local suppliers, specifically targeting suppliers within ARANSAS COUNTY, TX and Londonderry, NH locations.

**Inventory Management Adjustment:**
We acknowledge the issues highlighted in previous quarters with excessive inventory levels leading to capital tied up in non-moving stock. Vasil Mončev Stoile will lead the implementation of the Just-In-Time (JIT) system to address this concern. Inventory targets will be revised in line with historical sales data to ensure optimal stock levels.

**IT Upgrade Proposal:**
A proposal for an IT infrastructure upgrade has been submitted to improve logistics tracking and forecasting abilities. The IT department, under the supervision of Jacob Britt (jacob.britt@reynolds-owen.com), is evaluating software solutions that can integrate with our current systems to extend functionality. Feedback is expected by the end of April.

**Action Points:**
1. All department heads are required to review their current processes and submit a report on potential areas of improvement by April 21.
2. The procurement team must present a detailed assessment of potential new local suppliers by May 10.
3. Department heads should prepare their teams for training on new IT platforms projected to commence in early June.

**Next Steps:**
The operations team will coordinate a follow-up meeting on April 29 to discuss the integration of these strategic elements and the projected impacts on our quarterly performance. Any concerns or suggestions prior to this meeting should be directed to Eva Radosavljević Knego via email.
