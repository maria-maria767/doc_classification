Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you all in good health and high spirits. I am writing to share with you the sales report for the first quarter of 2023.

During the first quarter of 2023, our company has achieved a total sales revenue of $1,500,000. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for your hard work and dedication to our company's success. Without your efforts, we would not have been able to reach this milestone.

Vasil Mončev Stoile has been our top performer this quarter, achieving sales revenue of $400,000. Pando Daskalov Adelle, Eva Radosavljević Knego, you also have done a great job in contributing to the company’s sales revenue.
