Subject: New Sales Strategy and Training

Dear Maria,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to improve our sales performance, we have developed a new sales strategy that we believe will be more effective in reaching our target audience.

To ensure that all of our sales team is able to implement this new strategy, we will be conducting a training session on Tuesday, April 5th at 9am. The session will be led by our Sales Director, Killian, and will take place in the training room at our headquarters located at 39.3987494, Via Aurelio Saffi rd. on number 22e in Alfonsine, Emilia-Romagna state.

We expect all members of the sales team to attend this training session, and we will provide more details on the new strategy during the session. Please confirm that you have received this email and will be attending the training by replying to this email.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me or anyone on the sales team.

Thank you,

Nelson
