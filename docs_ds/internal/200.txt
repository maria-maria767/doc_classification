Hello Team,

As part of our ongoing effort to enhance interdepartmental collaboration and employee engagement, I am pleased to announce our upcoming quarterly team building activity, scheduled for Friday, June 23, 2023. The activity will be held at Sunshine Outdoor Adventures, with transportation departing from our main office at 8:00 AM and returning by 5:00 PM.

For this quarter's activity, we have arranged a series of events designed to foster teamwork, enhance communication skills, and encourage creative problem-solving. Activities will include a scavenger hunt, a high-ropes course, and a collaborative project that will contribute to a local charity.

Itinerary:
- 8:00 AM: Departure from the office

- 10:00 AM: Team Ice-Breaking Exercises
- 11:00 AM: Scavenger Hunt
- 1:00 PM: Catered Lunch

- 3:30 PM: Charity Project Collaboration
- 4:30 PM: Reflection and Group Discussion
- 5:00 PM: Departure back to the office

Attendance is mandatory for all employees, as these activities are a crucial part of fostering our company's culture and core values. A special exemption will apply only under extenuating circumstances and must be approved by the respective department head and myself.

Additionally, a photographer will be present to capture the day's events. These photos may be used for internal newsletters and our intranet, to share our team's experiences.

Please RSVP with the number of participants from your department and any dietary restrictions by no later than May 15, 2023. This will allow us to finalize our arrangements with the venue and caterers. RSVPs should be sent to Sarah Lee, Office Coordinator, at sarah.lee@companyemail.com.

I am looking forward to a productive and enjoyable day for everyone involved. If there are any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

Thank you for your cooperation and engagement.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
Director of Operations
