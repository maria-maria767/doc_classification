Subject: New Customer Acquisition Strategy

Dear Team,

I am happy to announce that we have successfully acquired a new customer, X Medical Srl. This is a significant achievement for our company, and I would like to thank everyone who was involved in the process.

As part of our new customer acquisition strategy, we will be implementing a comprehensive onboarding process for all new customers. This process will include personalized training sessions, regular check-ins with our customer success team, and a comprehensive review of our product offerings to ensure that we are meeting the unique needs of each customer.

To ensure that we provide the best possible service to our new customer, X Medical Srl, we will be assigning a dedicated account manager to work closely with their team. Our account manager will be responsible for identifying opportunities for growth, addressing any concerns or issues that may arise, and ensuring that our customer is satisfied with our products and services.

I am confident that our new customer acquisition strategy will help us to continue to grow our business and build long-term relationships with our customers. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me or your supervisor.

Best regards,

Dicho Avramov Jacob
CEO, First Impressions Training Solutions Pvt. Ltd.
