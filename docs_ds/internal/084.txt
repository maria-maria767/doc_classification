Dear Colleagues,

I trust this memorandum finds you well.

Purpose:
The purpose of this memo is to announce the rollout of our new Learning Management System (LMS), which is slated to go live next Monday. This system is an integral component in our mission to provide innovative and seamless tech learning solutions.

Implementation:
The IT department, lead by Elya Mirkovich Velizar, has been working diligently to ensure the successful integration of this system with our current infrastructure. We are at the final stages of testing and are confident that the transition will be smooth for all users.

Training:
It is mandatory for all staff members to attend a training session scheduled to be held this Thursday at 10:00 AM via our video conferencing platform. Additional training resources will be available on the LMS homepage.

Feedback:
We encourage everyone to provide feedback on the new system as it will be instrumental in addressing any teething issues and streamlining the user experience. Any queries or suggestions should be directed to the project team at as@williams-thompson.xyz.

Security:
Please note that the information contained within the LMS is proprietary and should not be shared outside of our organization. Ensure that all data handled aligns with our internal protocols for information security.

Action Required:
- Confirm your participation for the training session via email by EOD.
- Review your current projects to ensure all documentation is ready to be moved to the new system.
- Be prepared to allocate additional time next week to familiarize yourselves with the new system functionalities.

Contact Information:
Should there be any concerns or immediate issues regarding the LMS, please contact Elya Mirkovich Velizar at +1-838-271-3432 or via email at sm@burke-wilkerson.org.
