TO: All Department Heads

FROM: Dicho Avramov Jacob, CEO, X Medical SRL

SUBJECT: Internal Cleanliness and Maintenance Policy Update

Dear Department Heads,

As part of our ongoing efforts to maintain a healthy and productive work environment, we have updated our Cleanliness and Maintenance Policy.

Effective immediately, the following protocols will be implemented:

1. Clean Desk Policy - Each employee is required to maintain a clean and organized workstation. All sensitive documents should be stored in designated secure cabinets when not in use.

2. Common Areas - The cleanliness of common areas, such as the kitchen, break rooms, and meeting rooms, is now the collective responsibility of all employees. A rotating cleaning schedule will be instituted.

3. Recycling and Waste Disposal - Enhanced recycling stations will be set up on every floor. Employee cooperation in properly segregating and disposing of waste is mandatory.

4. Maintenance Requests – All requests for maintenance or repairs must be submitted to the Facilities Department using the new online form, accessible through the company’s intranet.

5. Personal Hygiene - A new Personal Hygiene Policy is now part of the employee handbook, ensuring that standards are maintained to prevent workplace health issues.

It is crucial that each department ensures compliance with these updated policies. Non-compliance will be noted and addressed accordingly.

Thank you for your cooperation and diligence in maintaining our company’s standards.

Please ensure to communicate these changes to all staff members and confirm receipt of this memorandum.

If there are any questions or clarifications needed regarding the updated policy, please do not hesitate to contact Francis, Head of Operations, at nicholasdorsey@shepherd.website or call 11469/ 17 233.

Kind Regards,

Dicho Avramov Jacob
CEO, X Medical SRL
