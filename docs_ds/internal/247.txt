**MEMORANDUM**

To: All Department Heads  
From: John Doe, Chief Operating Officer  
Date: April 15, 2023  
Subject: Updated Printing and Copying Policies

**Purpose**

The purpose of this memorandum is to inform you of the upgraded policies regarding printing and copying activities within the organization, effective immediately.

**Background**

Recent evaluations of company resource usage indicate that we have been using paper and ink supplies at an unsustainable rate. In light of this, the management has decided to implement stricter policies to reduce unnecessary costs and promote environmental sustainability in our daily operations.

**New Policy Details**

1. **Use of Print and Copy Services**: Going forward, all printing and copying must be job-related and necessary for business functions. Personal use of these resources is no longer permitted.

2. **Duplex Printing**: Duplex (double-sided) printing is now mandatory for all multi-page documents unless specifically required otherwise for official business reasons.

3. **Print Quality**: Standard print quality should be used for internal documents unless high quality is essential for client presentations or official external communications.

4. **Print Authorization**: Jobs exceeding 50 pages must be approved by the respective department head. Please use the print authorization form attached to this memo.

5. **Digital First Policy**: Employees are encouraged to share documents digitally rather than in paper format wherever possible. Please use company-approved platforms for sharing with colleagues.

6. **Recycling**: All employees are expected to utilize recycling bins for disposing of used paper products.

**Implementation**

The success of these new policies depends on the support and cooperation of everyone in the company. Department heads are responsible for ensuring their teams comply with these policies and for monitoring usage within their respective areas.

**Non-Compliance**

Failure to adhere to these policies will result in a review of the specific circumstances of non-compliance and may lead to corrective action.

**Conclusion**

By following these updated printing and copying policies, we will reduce unnecessary expense and environmental impact. Your support and compliance are greatly appreciated.

Please distribute this information to your team members and ensure that everyone is briefed on these changes by April 30, 2023.

Should you have any questions or concerns regarding these new policies, feel free to reach out to the Operations Department.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
