MEMORANDUM

To: All Department Heads
From: Viktor Dodos Dimitrij, Chief Operating Officer
Date: April 1, 2023
Subject: Implementation of New Work-From-Home Policy

Dear Team,

As part of our ongoing efforts to optimize operational efficiency and improve work-life balance for our employees, we are excited to announce that Meteksan Savunma Sanayii A.Ş. will be implementing a new work-from-home policy, effective immediately. This policy applies to all departments and is designed to offer greater flexibility while maintaining productivity and teamwork.

KEY POINTS OF THE POLICY:

1. Eligibility: Employees in roles that do not require physical presence at the office are eligible for up to three days of remote work per week. Department Heads will determine eligibility based on job functions.

2. Equipment: The company will provide necessary equipment, such as laptops and communication tools, to ensure a seamless remote working experience. Please contact Kairi Claudia Nemeth Archie from IT Support at 0800 11 79 or email at k-garza@wilkins-coleman.us to arrange for the delivery of equipment.

3. Communication: All remote employees must be reachable by phone and email during standard work hours. Regular check-ins with supervisors via video or voice call are mandatory to ensure continuity of work.

4. Data Security: Sensitivity towards data security must be maintained at the highest level. Always use the company’s VPN and secure channels for all work-related communications and data transfer.

5. Performance Metrics: Remote work should not impact the delivery and quality of work. Performance will be monitored through the same KPIs and metrics as in-office work.

ACTION REQUIRED:

- Department Heads are to review their team structures and submit a list of eligible employees for remote work to Amy in HR by April 7, 2023.
- Employees must acknowledge and sign the Remote Work Agreement by April 15, 2023. Failure to do so may result in revocation of remote work privileges.
- A remote work orientation session will be held via video conference on April 10, 2023, at 3:00 PM. Please ensure all eligible employees attend this session.

For any questions or clarification, please contact me directly at +1-025-621-8280 or via email at cramirez@gmail.com. We thank you for your cooperation and look forward to a smooth rollout of this new policy.

Best regards,

Viktor Dodos Dimitrij
