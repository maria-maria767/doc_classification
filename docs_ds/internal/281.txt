As we continue to grow, it is important that we maintain our internal policies to ensure the success of our organization. Therefore, we have made some changes to our internal policies and procedures that will go into effect immediately.

1. All employees are required to attend mandatory training sessions on our updated policies. The training sessions will be held in person and will be led by Dennis and Blagun Todorovski Drzislav.
2. All employees are required to submit a weekly report on their progress and any issues they may have encountered. These reports should be submitted to their supervisor by Friday of each week.
3. Our organization has implemented a new project management system. All employees are required to use this system for all projects and tasks.
4. We have also updated our vacation and sick leave policies. Employees are encouraged to review these changes and to plan their time off accordingly.

Please note that these changes are internal and should not be shared with anyone outside of the organization. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to HR or your supervisor. Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

Mark

CEO
